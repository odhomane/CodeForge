"""
CWD context injector — injects working directory into Claude's context
on every session start, user prompt, tool call, and subagent spawn.

Worktree-aware: when CWD is inside .claude/worktrees/, injects the project
root as the scope boundary instead of the worktree-specific path.
Git-root-aware: walks up from CWD to find .git, expanding scope to repository root.

Fires on: SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, SubagentStart
Always exits 0 (advisory, never blocking).
