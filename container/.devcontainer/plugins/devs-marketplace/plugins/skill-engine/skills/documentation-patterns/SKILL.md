description: >-
  Guides documentation authoring including README structure, docstring formats,
  API references, and architecture docs. USE WHEN the user asks to "write a
  README", "add docstrings", "add JSDoc", "document the API", "create
  architecture docs", "write documentation", "update the docs", or works with
  Google-style docstrings, Sphinx, rustdoc, TSDoc, OpenAPI annotations.
  DO NOT USE for writing code, fixing bugs, or generating changelogs.

# Documentation Patterns

## Mental Model

Documentation has **audiences**. README for new users, API docs for integrators, architecture docs for maintainers, inline docs for contributors. Wrong audience = wrong documentation. Before writing, identify who will read it and what they need to accomplish.

**Key principles:**
- **Accuracy over completeness.** Inaccurate documentation is worse than missing documentation. Only document behavior verified by reading code. Mark uncertainty with `TODO: verify`.
- **Audience determines format.** A README walks someone through getting started. An API reference lists every parameter with types. An architecture doc explains why decisions were made. Don't mix formats.
- **Code is the source of truth.** Never copy code into documentation — reference file paths instead. Copied snippets rot as soon as the source changes.
- **Concise, specific, active voice.** "Returns a list of users" not "A list of users is returned by this function." Cut filler words entirely.
- **Show, don't tell.** A working example communicates more than three paragraphs of explanation.

## Documentation Types and Audiences

| Type | Audience | Purpose | Format |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| **README** | New users, evaluators | What is this? How do I use it? | Markdown, top-level |
| **API Reference** | Integrators, consumers | Every endpoint/function with types and examples | Markdown or OpenAPI |
| **Architecture** | Maintainers, new team members | How the system works and why | Markdown with diagrams |
| **Inline (docstrings)** | Contributors, IDE users | What this function does, parameters, returns | Language-specific format |
| **Changelog** | Users, upgraders | What changed between versions | Markdown, keep-a-changelog format |
| **Configuration** | Operators, deployers | All config options with types and defaults | Markdown table or .env.example |

## README Structure

Answer five questions, in order:

### 1. What is this?

One paragraph. Project name, what it does, who it is for. No jargon. If someone reads only this paragraph, they should know whether to keep reading.

### 2. How do I install it?

Prerequisites (with exact versions), installation steps, environment setup. Copy-pasteable commands.

### 3. How do I use it?

Quick start example. Show the simplest possible usage that produces a visible result. Include the expected output.

### 4. How do I configure it?

Table of configuration options: name, type, required/optional, default, description. Environment variables, config files, CLI flags.

### 5. How do I contribute?

Development setup, how to run tests, how to submit changes. Link to CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

---

## Sizing Rules

Documentation files consumed by AI tools (CLAUDE.md, specs, architecture docs) should aim for **~200 lines** each. Split large documents by concern when practical. Each file should be independently useful.

For human-facing docs (README, API reference), there is no hard limit, but prefer shorter docs that link to detailed sub-pages over monolithic documents.

---

## Style Principles

1. **Concise** — "To configure..." not "In order to configure...". Cut "basically", "simply", "just", "actually".
2. **Specific** — Use exact types, values, and names. "`api_key` (string, required)" not "pass a key."
3. **Accurate** — Document only verified behavior. Mark uncertainty with `TODO: verify`.
4. **Active voice** — "The function returns a list" not "A list is returned."
5. **Show, don't tell** — Code examples over prose explanations.
6. **Consistent** — Match the project's existing documentation style for tense, format, and conventions.
7. **Audience-appropriate** — README uses everyday language. API docs use technical precision. Architecture docs explain rationale.

---

## Inline Documentation Strategy

### When to Document

Document every **public** function, class, and module. Skip private/internal helpers unless their behavior is non-obvious.

Priority order:
1. Public API functions and methods
2. Class/module-level docstrings
3. Complex algorithms (inline comments explaining *why*)
4. Configuration and constants with non-obvious values

### Style Detection

Before adding docstrings, check which style the project already uses:

```
# Python — look for existing patterns
Grep: """    → Google-style or NumPy-style
Grep: :param → Sphinx/reStructuredText
Grep: Parameters\n----------  → NumPy-style

# JavaScript/TypeScript
Grep: @param → JSDoc/TSDoc
Grep: @returns → JSDoc/TSDoc

# Go
Grep: ^// [A-Z].*function → godoc convention

# Rust
Grep: /// → rustdoc
Grep: //! → module-level rustdoc
```

Follow the existing style. If no docstrings exist, use the language's recommended default.

---

## Verification

Before finalizing documentation:

1. **Every command is correct** — Try running install commands, API examples, and code snippets against the actual project.
2. **Every path exists** — Reference only files that actually exist in the codebase.
3. **Every parameter matches the code** — Check function signatures against the documented parameters.
4. **Links work** — Verify internal references and external URLs.
5. **Version numbers are current** — Check package versions in install commands.

---

## Ambiguity Policy

| Ambiguity | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| **Audience not specified** | Write for the most common audience for the doc type (README → new users, docstrings → contributors) |
| **Scope not specified** | Document the public API surface; skip internals |
| **Format not specified** | Follow existing project conventions; fall back to language defaults |
| **Level of detail** | Include parameters, return values, and one example per function |
| **Behavior uncertain** | Mark with `TODO: verify — [specific question]` rather than guessing |
