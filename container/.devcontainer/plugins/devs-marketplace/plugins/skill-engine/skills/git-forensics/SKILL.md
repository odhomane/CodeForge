# Git Forensics

## Mental Model

Git is a **forensic evidence system**. Every commit is a timestamped, attributed snapshot of a decision someone made. The history doesn't just record *what* changed -- it records *who* changed it, *when* they changed it, and (if commit messages are good) *why* they changed it.

Git forensics answers questions that code alone cannot:
- "When did this behavior change?" -- `git bisect`
- "Who last touched this logic and why?" -- `git blame`
- "When was this function deleted?" -- `git log -S`
- "What did this file look like 6 months ago?" -- `git show`
- "I accidentally reset -- can I recover?" -- `git reflog`

The key insight is that git stores *content*, not *files*. Git tracks blobs of content, and commands like `git log -S` search for when content was added or removed regardless of which file it was in. This makes git a powerful search engine for code archaeology.

Approach every investigation with a hypothesis. Start with the broadest tool (`git log`) to narrow the timeframe, then use focused tools (`git blame`, `git bisect`) to identify the exact commit.

## Essential Commands

These commands form the daily toolkit for understanding code history:

```bash
# Compact commit history with branch topology
git log --oneline --graph --all

# History of a specific file
git log --oneline -- path/to/file.py

# Show what changed in a specific commit
git show abc1234

# Show a file at a specific commit
git show abc1234:path/to/file.py

# Diff between two commits
git diff abc1234 def5678

# Diff between two branches
git diff main..feature-branch

# Who last modified each line (with commit and date)
git blame path/to/file.py

# Blame a specific line range
git blame -L 42,60 path/to/file.py
```

---

## Advanced Archaeology

### Pickaxe Search (`-S`)

Find commits that **added or removed** a specific string. This is the most powerful tool for finding when code appeared or disappeared:

```bash
# Find when "calculate_tax" was added or removed
git log -S "calculate_tax" --oneline

# With diff to see the actual change
git log -S "calculate_tax" -p

# Restrict to specific files
git log -S "calculate_tax" --oneline -- "*.py"
```

`-S` counts occurrences -- it finds commits where the number of times the string appears changed. It's fast because it doesn't need to regex-match every line of every diff.

### Regex Search (`-G`)

Find commits where **a line matching a regex was added or removed**. More flexible than `-S` but slower:

```bash
# Find commits that changed lines containing a pattern
git log -G "def\s+calculate_\w+" --oneline

# Combined with file filter
git log -G "TODO|FIXME|HACK" --oneline -- "*.py"
```

The difference: `-S "foo"` finds commits where the count of "foo" changed. `-G "foo"` finds commits where any changed line matches "foo". Use `-S` for exact strings, `-G` for patterns.

### Follow Renames (`--follow`)

Track a file across renames. Without `--follow`, history stops at the rename:

```bash
# Follow a file through renames
git log --follow --oneline -- path/to/current_name.py

# Show patch history through renames
git log --follow -p -- path/to/file.py
```

### Contributor Statistics

```bash
# Commits per author (sorted)
git shortlog -sn --no-merges

# Commits per author in a date range
git shortlog -sn --after="2024-01-01" --before="2024-07-01"

# Files most frequently changed (hot spots)
git log --pretty=format: --name-only | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

## Bisect Workflow

`git bisect` performs a binary search through commit history to find the exact commit that introduced a bug. It halves the search space with each step.

### Manual Bisect

```bash
# Start bisecting
git bisect start

# Mark the current commit as bad (has the bug)
git bisect bad

# Mark a known-good commit (did not have the bug)
git bisect good v2.1.0

# Git checks out a middle commit. Test it, then:
git bisect good    # if this commit doesn't have the bug
git bisect bad     # if this commit has the bug

# Repeat until git identifies the first bad commit
# When done:
git bisect reset   # return to your original branch
```

For 1000 commits, bisect finds the culprit in ~10 steps (log2(1000)).

### Automated Bisect

Provide a test script that exits 0 for good and non-zero for bad:

```bash
# Automated bisect with a test command
git bisect start HEAD v2.1.0
git bisect run pytest tests/test_tax.py -x

# Or with a custom script
git bisect run bash -c '
    python -c "from myapp import calculate_tax; assert calculate_tax(100) == 7.5"
'
```

The test script must be:
- **Self-contained** -- it can't rely on state from previous runs
- **Deterministic** -- same commit, same result
- **Fast** -- it runs once per bisect step; slow tests multiply the total time

Exit code 125 tells bisect to skip the current commit (useful for commits that don't compile).

## Blame Deep Dive

Basic `git blame` shows the last commit to touch each line, but that's often a formatting change or bulk rename. Use flags to look deeper:

```bash
# Ignore whitespace changes
git blame -w path/to/file.py

# Detect lines moved within the file
git blame -M path/to/file.py

# Detect lines moved or copied from other files
git blame -C path/to/file.py

# Stack all three for maximum accuracy
git blame -w -M -C path/to/file.py

# Blame at a specific commit (go back before a known refactoring)
git blame abc1234^ -- path/to/file.py
```

### .git-blame-ignore-revs

Large formatting commits (running `black`, `prettier`, or `gofmt`) pollute blame output. Create a file listing commits to skip:

```bash
# Create .git-blame-ignore-revs at repo root
echo "# Black formatting pass" >> .git-blame-ignore-revs
echo "abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234" >> .git-blame-ignore-revs

# Configure git to use it
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

Commit `.git-blame-ignore-revs` to the repo so the whole team benefits. GitHub and GitLab both respect this file in their web UI.

## Reflog Recovery

The reflog records every change to `HEAD` and branch tips, even those not reachable from any branch. It's your safety net for recovering from mistakes.

```bash
# Show recent HEAD movements
git reflog

# Show reflog for a specific branch
git reflog show feature-branch

# Typical output:
# abc1234 HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD~3
# def5678 HEAD@{1}: commit: add user validation
# 789abcd HEAD@{2}: commit: fix login bug

# Recover a commit after accidental reset
git reflog                          # find the commit hash
git branch recovery-branch abc1234  # create a branch pointing to it

# Recover after accidental branch delete
git reflog | grep "feature-branch"  # find the last commit
git branch feature-branch abc1234   # recreate the branch
```

**Reflog lifetime:** By default, unreachable reflog entries expire after 30 days, reachable ones after 90 days. For critical recovery, act within this window. Running `git gc` prunes expired entries.

**What reflog can recover:**
- Commits after `git reset --hard`
- Deleted branches
- Amended commits (the pre-amend version)
- Rebased commits (the pre-rebase versions)
- Stash drops (via `git fsck --unreachable` if reflog also expired)

**What reflog cannot recover:**
- Uncommitted changes (never tracked by git)
- Changes after `git checkout -- file` (working tree overwrite)

---

## Ambiguity Policy

These defaults apply when the user does not specify a preference. State the assumption when making a choice:

- **Search scope:** Default to the current branch. Add `--all` only when the user says "in any branch" or "across all branches".
- **Blame flags:** Default to `git blame -w -M -C` to skip whitespace and detect moves/copies. Drop flags only if the user wants raw blame.
- **Log format:** Default to `--oneline` for browsing, `-p` (patch) when the user needs to see the actual changes.
- **Bisect automation:** Default to manual bisect unless the user provides a test command or the project has a clear test suite.
- **Recovery strategy:** After finding a lost commit via reflog, default to creating a new branch rather than force-resetting an existing branch.
- **File scope:** When investigating a specific function, use `-L` (line range) or `-S` (function name) rather than blaming the entire file.
