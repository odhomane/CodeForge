  Guides incremental, rollback-safe framework upgrades and dependency
  migrations with step-by-step verification. USE WHEN the user asks to
  "migrate from X to Y", "upgrade to version N", "bump Python version",
  "upgrade pydantic", "migrate express to fastify", "modernize the codebase",
  or works with Pydantic v1-to-v2, Django upgrades, CommonJS to ESM.
  DO NOT USE for routine dependency updates without API changes.

# Migration Patterns

## Mental Model

Migrations are a sequence of **small, verifiable, rollback-safe transformations**. Each step must independently compile, pass tests, and leave the system in a valid state. The moment you batch changes or skip verification, you create a state that is harder to debug than the original problem.

**Key principles:**
- **One thing at a time.** Each migration step changes one category of code (imports, API calls, configuration, types). Mixing categories makes failures hard to isolate.
- **Verify after every step.** Build → Test → Lint after each transformation. A broken intermediate state that goes undetected compounds into an undebuggable mess.
- **Rollback is always an option.** Git checkpoints after each successful step. If step N fails, you can revert to step N-1 cleanly.
- **Import mapping first.** Most framework migrations change import paths. Map all imports before modifying call sites — this gives you a complete inventory of affected code.
- **Official guides are the source of truth.** Always fetch and read the official migration guide before planning. Community blog posts may be outdated or incomplete.

## Migration Planning Framework

Follow this sequence for every migration:

### 1. Assess Current State

- Read manifest files to identify current version and all dependencies.
- Use `Glob` and `Grep` to inventory usage of the APIs being migrated.
- Count occurrences of each deprecated pattern to estimate effort.

### 2. Read Official Guides

- Use `WebFetch` to pull the official migration guide, changelog, and breaking changes list.
- Note every breaking change that applies to the project.
- Identify changes with no direct replacement — these need special handling.

### 3. Inventory Affected Files

- Map every file that uses a deprecated API or pattern.
- Group files by change type (imports, API calls, configuration, types).
- Count total changes per group to estimate per-step effort.

### 4. Order Steps

Sequence changes so each step is independently buildable:

1. **Configuration** — Manifest files, build configs, tool configs
2. **Core utilities and shared modules** — Changes here propagate to dependents
3. **Business logic** — Module by module, starting with lowest dependency count
4. **Route handlers / controllers** — Often the most numerous changes
5. **Tests** — Updated last to match migrated source

### 5. Risk Assessment

Flag high-risk changes:
- Behavioral changes (same API, different default behavior)
- Removed APIs with no direct replacement
- Database schema changes
- Serialization format changes (affects stored data)

### 6. Present Plan

Output numbered steps with:
- File count per step
- Risk level (low / medium / high)
- Verification command
- Rollback command

## Step Verification Protocol

After each migration step, run these checks in order:

| Check | Command Examples | Purpose |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| **Syntax** | `python -m py_compile`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `node --check` | Code parses correctly |
| **Build** | `npm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build ./...` | Project compiles |
| **Tests** | `pytest`, `npm test`, `cargo test`, `go test ./...` | Behavior preserved |
| **Lint** | `ruff check`, `npm run lint`, `cargo clippy` | Style and correctness |

If any check fails:
1. Identify which change in this step caused the failure.
2. Fix within the current step — do not proceed to the next.
3. If the fix is unclear, report the failure with full error output.
4. Never fix forward by making changes intended for later steps.

## Rollback Strategy

- **Before starting**: Verify the user has committed or stashed current work.
- **After each step**: Suggest a commit checkpoint: "Step N complete — recommend committing now."
- **On failure**: Provide exact `git checkout -- <files>` commands to revert to the last good state.
- **Database migrations**: Always plan the down-migration alongside the up-migration.
- **Feature flags**: For gradual migrations, consider feature flags to run old and new code paths in parallel.

## Import-First Strategy

Most framework migrations change import paths. Map imports before modifying call sites:

1. **Inventory**: `Grep` for all imports from the old framework/library.
2. **Map**: Create a mapping of old import → new import.
3. **Transform**: Change all imports in a single step.
4. **Verify**: Build and test after import changes (some imports may have side effects).
5. **Proceed**: With imports correct, modify call sites knowing the right modules are loaded.

This approach gives you a complete inventory of affected code before making any behavioral changes.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Fails | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Batching all changes | One failure breaks everything; can't isolate cause | One category per step |
| Skipping verification | Errors compound silently | Build + test after every step |
| Fixing forward | New changes mask existing failures | Fix in current step or revert |
| Ignoring transitive deps | A dependency may not support the target version | Check compatibility first |
| Mixing migration with refactoring | Two concerns, double the failure modes | Migrate first, refactor later |
| Not reading the migration guide | Miss non-obvious behavioral changes | Official guide before planning |

---

## Ambiguity Policy

| Ambiguity | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| **Verification depth** | Full suite: build + test + lint after every step |
| **Step granularity** | One file category per step (imports, then API calls, then config) |
| **Unknown migration path** | Fetch docs, analyze both APIs, present mapping for review |
| **Partial migration requested** | Warn about inconsistency; verify the module's own tests pass |
| **Target version not specified** | Migrate to the latest stable release |
