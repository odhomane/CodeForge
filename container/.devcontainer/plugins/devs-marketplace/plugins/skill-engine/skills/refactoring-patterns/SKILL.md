# Refactoring Patterns

## Mental Model

Refactoring is **behavior-preserving transformation** -- you change the structure of code without changing what it does. The key word is *preserving*. Every refactoring step must leave the system in a working state. If you can't verify the behavior hasn't changed, you're not refactoring -- you're rewriting.

Tests are the safety net. Before touching any code, confirm that tests pass. After every transformation, run tests again. If there are no tests, write characterization tests first -- tests that capture the current behavior, even if that behavior is buggy. Fix bugs separately from refactoring; mixing the two makes both harder to verify.

The refactoring cycle is:
1. **Identify** a code smell (a surface indicator of a deeper structural problem)
2. **Choose** the appropriate transformation
3. **Apply** the transformation in the smallest possible step
4. **Verify** tests still pass
5. **Commit** before moving to the next smell

Small steps are critical. A refactoring that touches 15 files in one commit is a rewrite wearing a disguise. Each commit should be independently revertable.

## Code Smell Catalog

Code smells are heuristics, not rules. A method with 30 lines might be perfectly clear; a method with 8 lines might hide a design problem. Use these as starting points for investigation, not automatic triggers for refactoring.

### Long Method
**Detection:** Method exceeds ~20 lines, or you need to scroll to see the whole thing, or you find yourself writing comments to separate logical sections.
**Root cause:** The method has accumulated responsibilities over time.
**Fix:** Extract Function -- pull each commented section or logical block into a named function.

### Feature Envy
**Detection:** A method accesses data from another object more than its own. Count the dots -- `order.customer.address.city` suggests the method belongs elsewhere.
**Root cause:** Behavior is in the wrong class.
**Fix:** Move Method to the class whose data it uses most.

### Data Clump
**Detection:** The same group of parameters appears together in multiple function signatures (`x, y, z` or `host, port, protocol`).
**Root cause:** A missing abstraction -- these values form a concept that deserves its own type.
**Fix:** Introduce Parameter Object or extract a dataclass/type.

### Primitive Obsession
**Detection:** Using `str` for email, `int` for currency, `dict` for structured data. Business rules are scattered across validation checks.
**Root cause:** Domain concepts are represented as raw primitives instead of types.
**Fix:** Replace Primitive with Value Object -- create a type that encapsulates the value and its constraints.

### God Class
**Detection:** A class with 500+ lines, 20+ methods, or a name like `Manager`, `Handler`, `Processor`, `Utils`. It knows about everything and everything depends on it.
**Root cause:** Single Responsibility Principle violation accumulated over time.
**Fix:** Extract Class -- identify clusters of related fields and methods, pull each cluster into its own class.

### Shotgun Surgery
**Detection:** A single conceptual change requires editing 5+ files in the same way. Adding a new status enum value means updating the model, serializer, validator, template, and two tests.
**Root cause:** A concept is spread across too many places without a central abstraction.
**Fix:** Move Method / Move Field to consolidate the scattered logic, or introduce a registry/dispatch pattern.

### Divergent Change
**Detection:** One class changes for multiple unrelated reasons -- the `User` class changes when auth logic changes AND when profile rendering changes.
**Root cause:** The class has multiple responsibilities that change at different rates.
**Fix:** Extract Class to separate the responsibilities.

### Message Chain
**Detection:** A chain of calls like `a.getB().getC().getD().doSomething()`. Each link in the chain is a coupling point.
**Root cause:** Client code knows too much about the object graph.
**Fix:** Hide Delegate -- provide a method on the first object that reaches through the chain internally.

## Safe Refactoring Steps

Each transformation below is mechanical and behavior-preserving when applied correctly. Follow the steps exactly.

### Extract Function
**When:** A block of code inside a method can be grouped under a descriptive name.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Order:
    items: list
    total: float
    customer: "Customer"

# Before
def process_order(order: Order) -> None:
    # validate
    if not order.items:
        raise ValueError("Empty order")
    if order.total < 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative total")
    # apply discount
    if order.customer.is_premium:
        order.total *= 0.9

# After
def process_order(order: Order) -> None:
    validate_order(order)
    apply_premium_discount(order)

def validate_order(order: Order) -> None:
    if not order.items:
        raise ValueError("Empty order")
    if order.total < 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative total")

def apply_premium_discount(order: Order) -> None:
    if order.customer.is_premium:
        order.total *= 0.9
```

### Inline Variable
**When:** A temporary variable adds no clarity and is used only once.

```typescript
// Before
const basePrice = order.quantity * order.itemPrice;
return basePrice;

// After
return order.quantity * order.itemPrice;
```

### Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
**When:** A switch or if-chain selects behavior based on a type field.

```python
import math
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Before
def calculate_area(shape):
    if shape.type == "circle":
        return math.pi * shape.radius ** 2
    elif shape.type == "rectangle":
        return shape.width * shape.height

# After
@dataclass
class Circle:
    radius: float

    def area(self) -> float:
        return math.pi * self.radius ** 2

@dataclass
class Rectangle:
    width: float
    height: float

    def area(self) -> float:
        return self.width * self.height
```

### Introduce Parameter Object
**When:** Multiple parameters travel together across function boundaries.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Before
def search(query: str, page: int, per_page: int, sort_by: str, order: str): ...
def count(query: str, sort_by: str, order: str): ...

# After
@dataclass
class SearchParams:
    query: str
    page: int = 1
    per_page: int = 20
    sort_by: str = "relevance"
    order: str = "desc"

def search(params: SearchParams): ...
def count(params: SearchParams): ...
```

### Pull Up Method
**When:** A method in a subclass is identical across all subclasses.

```python
# Before: duplicated method in both subclasses
class SalariedEmployee(Employee):
    def annual_cost(self) -> float:
        return self.salary * 1.3  # 30% benefits overhead

class HourlyEmployee(Employee):
    def annual_cost(self) -> float:
        return self.salary * 1.3  # identical logic

# After: pulled up to parent
class Employee:
    def annual_cost(self) -> float:
        return self.salary * 1.3
```

### Push Down Method
**When:** A method in the parent is only relevant to one subclass.

```python
# Before: method in parent used by only one subclass
class Employee:
    def commission_rate(self) -> float:  # only SalesRep uses this
        return 0.05

# After: pushed down to the relevant subclass
class SalesRep(Employee):
    def commission_rate(self) -> float:
        return 0.05
```

## Language-Specific Patterns

### Python

**Dataclasses over raw dicts:**
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Before: dict with implicit schema
user = {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "role": "admin"}

# After: explicit, typed, with defaults
@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    email: str
    role: str = "viewer"
```

**Comprehensions over manual loops:**
```python
# Before
result = []
for item in items:
    if item.is_active():
        result.append(item.name)

# After
result = [item.name for item in items if item.is_active()]
```

**Context managers over try/finally:**
```python
# Before
f = open("data.txt")
try:
    data = f.read()
finally:
    f.close()

# After
with open("data.txt") as f:
    data = f.read()
```

### TypeScript

**Type narrowing over type assertions:**
```typescript
// Before: unsafe assertion
const user = data as User;

// After: runtime narrowing
function isUser(data: unknown): data is User {
    return typeof data === "object" && data !== null && "email" in data;
}
if (isUser(data)) {
    console.log(data.email); // safely narrowed
}
```

**Discriminated unions over type fields:**
```typescript
// Before: stringly-typed
interface Shape { type: string; radius?: number; width?: number; height?: number; }

// After: discriminated union
type Shape =
    | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }
    | { kind: "rectangle"; width: number; height: number };
```

## Verification Protocol

Every refactoring session follows this protocol:

1. **Run all tests** before starting. If tests fail, fix them first -- don't refactor broken code.
2. **Make one transformation** at a time. Extract one function, rename one variable, move one method.
3. **Run tests** after every transformation. If tests fail, revert immediately -- don't debug a failed refactoring.
4. **Commit** each passing transformation. Atomic commits make bisecting easy if something breaks later.
5. **Review the diff** before pushing. Does each change preserve behavior? Are there unintended side effects?

```bash
# The refactoring loop
git stash        # save any unrelated work
pytest           # green? proceed. red? fix first.

# ... make ONE transformation ...

pytest           # green? commit. red? git checkout -- .
git add -p       # stage only the refactoring
git commit -m "refactor: extract validate_order from process_order"
```

---

## Ambiguity Policy

These defaults apply when the user does not specify a preference. State the assumption when making a choice:

- **Scope:** Default to the smallest transformation that addresses the identified smell. Do not chain multiple refactorings without testing between each step.
- **Test requirement:** If no tests exist, write characterization tests before refactoring. Do not refactor untested code.
- **Naming:** When extracting a function, name it after what it does, not how it does it. Prefer verbs (`validate_order`) over nouns (`order_validation`).
- **Depth:** Default to one level of extraction. If the extracted function itself has smells, address them in a separate commit.
- **Language idioms:** Prefer language-native patterns (Python dataclasses over hand-rolled `__init__`, TypeScript discriminated unions over type assertions).
- **Commit granularity:** One refactoring transformation per commit. Multiple files in one commit is fine if they're part of the same transformation.
