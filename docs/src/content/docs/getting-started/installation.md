This guide walks you through setting up CodeForge from scratch. The process has three steps: run the installer, open the container, and verify. Most of the heavy lifting happens automatically.

## Step 1: Install CodeForge

Navigate to your project root and run:

```bash
npx @coredirective/cf-container
```

This creates a `.devcontainer/` directory containing the full CodeForge configuration — all plugins, features, agents, skills, system prompts, and settings. Your existing project files are not modified.

:::tip[Already have a .devcontainer?]
If your project already has a `.devcontainer/` directory, the installer will warn you and exit. Two flags handle this:

```bash
npx @coredirective/cf-container --force    # Smart update (preserves your customizations)
npx @coredirective/cf-container --reset    # Fresh install (wipes .devcontainer, keeps .codeforge)
```

**`--force`** uses an intelligent sync — it preserves files you've customized (writing `.default` copies of new defaults in `.codeforge/` for review) rather than blindly overwriting everything. Use this for routine updates.

**`--reset`** deletes `.devcontainer/` entirely and copies clean defaults from the package. Your `.codeforge/` user configuration is always preserved. Use this when `.devcontainer/` is corrupted or you want a clean slate.
:::

### Alternative Installation Methods

```bash
# Install globally for repeated use
npm install -g @coredirective/cf-container
@coredirective/cf-container

# Pin a specific version
npx @coredirective/cf-container@2.1.0
```

### What the Installer Creates

After running the installer, your project will have:

```
your-project/
├── .devcontainer/
│   ├── devcontainer.json       # Container definition and feature list
│   ├── .env                    # Setup flags
│   ├── features/               # 22 custom DevContainer features
│   ├── plugins/                # 17 plugins with hooks and scripts
│   └── scripts/                # Setup and verification scripts
├── .codeforge/
│   ├── file-manifest.json      # Controls config file deployment
│   ├── config/                 # System prompts, settings, rules
│   └── scripts/                # Terminal connection scripts
└── ... (your existing files)
```

## Step 2: Open in a DevContainer Client

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

CodeForge uses the open [Dev Containers specification](https://containers.dev/). Pick whichever client fits your workflow:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="VS Code">

Open your project in VS Code. You should see a notification in the bottom-right corner:

> **Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file.** Reopen folder to develop in a container.

Click **Reopen in Container**. If you miss the notification, use the Command Palette:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
2. Type "Dev Containers" and select **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**

You can watch the build progress in the "Dev Containers" output channel in the terminal panel.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="DevContainer CLI">

Install the CLI and build the container:

```bash
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . zsh
```

For the full CLI workflow — connecting, port forwarding, rebuilding, and tips — see the dedicated [DevContainer CLI guide](./devcontainer-cli/).

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JetBrains">

1. Open **JetBrains Gateway** (or IntelliJ IDEA / PyCharm with the [Dev Containers plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21962-dev-containers))
2. Select **Dev Containers** as the connection type
3. Point to your project directory containing `.devcontainer/`
4. Gateway builds the container and connects the IDE backend automatically

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Codespaces">

1. Push your project (with the `.devcontainer/` directory) to GitHub
2. Go to your repository on GitHub and click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace**
3. Codespaces reads your `devcontainer.json` and builds the environment in the cloud

No local Docker installation required. Port forwarding is handled automatically by Codespaces.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### What Happens During the First Build

The first container build takes several minutes (typically 3-8 minutes depending on your internet speed and hardware). Here's what's happening behind the scenes:

1. **Base image pull** — downloads the Python 3.14 DevContainer image from Microsoft's registry
2. **Feature installation** — installs DevContainer features in dependency order: Node.js and uv first (other tools depend on them), then Bun, Claude Code, and all custom features
3. **Post-start setup** — deploys configuration files, sets up shell aliases, and configures plugins

:::caution[Don't interrupt the first build]
If the build is interrupted, Docker may cache a partial state. Rebuild without cache to start fresh:
- **VS Code**: Dev Containers: Rebuild Container Without Cache
- **CLI**: `devcontainer up --workspace-folder . --remove-existing-container`
:::

## Step 3: Verify Installation

Once the container is running and you have a terminal prompt, verify everything installed correctly:

```bash
check-setup
```

This command checks that all tools, runtimes, and plugins are in place. You should see green checkmarks for each component.

For a more detailed view of every installed tool and its version:

```bash
cc-tools
```

This lists every command CodeForge provides, along with its version number or installation status.

### Expected Output

A healthy installation shows all of these as available:

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Claude Code | `claude`, `cc`, `ccw`, `ccraw` |
| Session tools | `ccusage`, `ccburn` (disabled by default), `claude-monitor` (`ccms` currently disabled) |
| Languages | `node`, `python`, `bun` (`rustc` opt-in) |
| Code intelligence | `ast-grep`, `tree-sitter`, `pyright`, `typescript-language-server` |
| Linters/Formatters | `ruff`, `biome` |
| Utilities | `gh`, `docker`, `git`, `jq`, `tmux` |

:::note[Some tools are optional]
A few features ship with `"version": "none"` by default (shfmt, dprint, shellcheck, hadolint). These are available but disabled. Enable them by changing the version in `devcontainer.json` and rebuilding the container.
:::

## What Gets Installed

### Language Runtimes

- **Python 3.14** — the container's base image, with `uv` as the package manager
- **Node.js LTS** — installed via nvm, with npm included
- **Rust** — latest stable via rustup _(opt-in — uncomment in `devcontainer.json`)_
- **Bun** — fast JavaScript/TypeScript runtime and package manager
- **Go** — available as an opt-in (uncomment in `devcontainer.json`)

### CLI Tools

- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) — repository management, PR creation, issue tracking
- **Docker** (Docker-outside-of-Docker) — container operations from inside the DevContainer
- **tmux** — terminal multiplexing for parallel Claude Code sessions
- **ccms** — search your Claude Code session history _(currently disabled — replaced by `codeforge session search`)_
- **ccusage** / **ccburn** — token usage analysis and burn rate tracking
- **ccstatusline** — session status in your terminal prompt
- **claude-monitor** — real-time session monitoring
- **codeforge-dashboard** — web-based session analytics on port 7847 _(opt-in — may not be available if the feature is disabled)_
- **agent-browser** — headless Chromium via Playwright for web interaction
- **ast-grep** / **tree-sitter** — structural code search and parsing

### Plugins

All 17 plugins are installed and active by default. They're configured through `settings.json` and managed by the plugin system. See the [Plugins Overview](../plugins/) for details on each plugin and how to enable or disable them.

## Configuration

CodeForge works out of the box, but everything is customizable:

- **`devcontainer.json`** — container image, features, resource limits, port forwarding
- **`.codeforge/config/settings.json`** — model selection, permissions, enabled plugins, environment variables
- **`.codeforge/config/main-system-prompt.md`** — Claude Code's behavioral guidelines
- **`.codeforge/config/rules/`** — rules loaded into every session automatically

See the [Customization section](../customization/) for full details on each configuration surface.

## Updating CodeForge

To update to the latest version:

```bash
npx @coredirective/cf-container@latest
```

This updates the `.devcontainer/` configuration. After updating, rebuild the container:

- **VS Code**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and select **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container**
- **CLI**: `devcontainer up --workspace-folder . --remove-existing-container`

:::tip[Check what changed]
Use `git diff .devcontainer/` after updating to review what changed before committing. This lets you verify the update didn't overwrite any customizations you want to keep.

## Troubleshooting

Having trouble with the build, authentication, or missing tools? See the [Troubleshooting reference](../reference/troubleshooting/) for solutions to common issues including:

- Container build failures and slow builds
- `npx @coredirective/cf-container` installation errors
- VS Code not showing the DevContainer prompt
- Claude Code authentication problems
- Docker permissions on Linux and WSL 2 integration on Windows
- Port conflicts

## Next Steps
