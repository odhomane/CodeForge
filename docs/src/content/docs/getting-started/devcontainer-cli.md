The DevContainer CLI lets you build and run CodeForge containers without VS Code. Use it when you prefer terminal-only workflows, work on headless servers, or need DevContainer support in CI/CD pipelines.

## Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
```

Requires Node.js 16.13+ or 18+ (when installing via npm). Verify the installation with `devcontainer --version`.

## Build and Start

From your project root (where `.devcontainer/` lives):

```bash
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
```

The first build takes several minutes — it pulls the base image, installs all features, and runs post-start setup. Subsequent starts reuse cached layers and complete in seconds.

:::caution[Don't interrupt the first build]
If the build is interrupted, Docker may cache a partial state. Rebuild from scratch:
```bash
devcontainer up --workspace-folder . --remove-existing-container
```
:::

## Connect to the Container

The recommended way to get a shell inside the container:

```bash
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . zsh
```

This uses the devcontainer CLI's exec command, which respects the container's configured user and environment. You can also use `docker exec` directly — run `docker ps` to find the container name:

```bash
docker exec -it <container-name> zsh
```

## Run Commands

Execute commands without entering an interactive shell:

```bash
# Run check-setup to verify the installation
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . check-setup

# Launch a Claude Code session
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . cc

# List installed tools
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . cc-tools
```

## Port Forwarding

VS Code auto-forwards container ports to your host automatically. **The CLI does not.** You need an explicit forwarding mechanism.

:::caution[No automatic port forwarding]
Unlike VS Code, the devcontainer CLI does not auto-forward ports. Services running inside the container (like the Claude Dashboard on port 7847) won't be accessible on your host unless you set up forwarding manually. Note that the dashboard requires enabling the feature in your DevContainer configuration.
:::

**Recommended:** Install [devcontainer-bridge](https://github.com/bradleybeddoes/devcontainer-bridge) (`dbr`) for dynamic, automatic port forwarding that works with any terminal client. CodeForge pre-installs the container side — you only need the host daemon:

```bash
# On your host machine
dbr host-daemon
```

**Alternative:** Use SSH tunneling for specific ports:

```bash
ssh -L 7847:localhost:7847 <container-user>@<container-host>
```

See [Port Forwarding](/reference/port-forwarding/) for the full setup guide and comparison of all forwarding mechanisms.

## Key Differences from VS Code

| Capability | VS Code | DevContainer CLI |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| Port forwarding | Automatic | Manual — use `dbr` or SSH tunneling |
| Extensions panel | GUI in sidebar | Not available |
| Ports panel | Visual port management | Not available — use `docker port` or `dbr` |
| Terminal management | Integrated tabs | Manual — use tmux for parallel sessions |
| File editing | Built-in editor | Use your preferred editor (vim, nano, etc.) |

## Rebuilding

When you change `devcontainer.json` or feature configurations, rebuild:

```bash
# Rebuild using cached layers (fast)
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .

# Full rebuild from scratch (slow, but fixes cache issues)
devcontainer up --workspace-folder . --remove-existing-container
```

## Stopping the Container

The devcontainer CLI doesn't have a dedicated stop command. Use Docker directly:

```bash
# Find the container name
docker ps

# Stop the container
docker stop <container-name>

# Or stop and remove it
docker rm -f <container-name>
```

## Tips

- **Use tmux** for parallel sessions inside the container. CodeForge installs tmux by default — run `tmux` after connecting to get split panes and persistent sessions.
- **Connect external terminals** using the scripts in `.codeforge/scripts/` — `connect-external-terminal.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `connect-external-terminal.ps1` (Windows PowerShell).
- **Combine with `dbr`** for the closest experience to VS Code — automatic port forwarding without needing VS Code running.
