## Versioning Policy

CodeForge follows semantic versioning:

- **Major** (X.0.0) — Breaking changes that require migration steps
- **Minor** (0.X.0) — New features and enhancements, backward compatible
- **Patch** (0.0.X) — Bug fixes with no feature changes

Breaking changes are rare. Most releases are minor versions that add new plugins, skills, or tools without requiring any user action beyond updating.

## Update Process

```bash
# Update to latest version
npx codeforge-dev@latest

# Update to a specific version
npx codeforge-dev@1.14.0
```

After updating, rebuild your DevContainer to apply changes:

1. Open the VS Code command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Select **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container**

:::tip[Non-Breaking Updates]
For minor and patch updates, you can usually just rebuild the container. Check the changelog entries below for any migration notes before upgrading across multiple major versions.

## Version History

## v2.1.0 — 2026-03-25

### CLI

- **`codeforge proxy`** — launch Claude Code through mitmproxy for full API traffic inspection. Starts mitmweb in the background, proxies all Claude API requests through it, and opens a browser UI at `http://localhost:8081` for real-time request/response inspection. Auto-installs mitmproxy via pipx on first use, handles CA certificate generation and system trust store installation. Supports `--no-web` for headless mitmdump output, `--setup` for install-only, and `-- <claude-args>` passthrough. Useful for monitoring token usage, cache behavior, and rate limit utilization — the `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` response headers on `/v1/messages` requests show 5-hour and 7-day quota utilization even with long-lived auth tokens.
- **Version lock** — set `CLAUDE_VERSION_LOCK=<semver>` in `.env` to pin Claude Code to a specific version. The update script installs the exact version instead of updating to latest. Background auto-updater disabled via `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER`.

### Dashboard

- **First-party dashboard** — replaced third-party `claude-session-dashboard` npm package with `codeforge-dashboard` (built from monorepo `dashboard/` package)
- Auto-launch on container start via poststart hook (controllable with `autostart` option)
- Install switched from npm to Bun (`bun install -g`)
- Command renamed: `claude-dashboard` → `codeforge-dashboard`
- Removed persistence symlink hook (dashboard DB now lives on bind mount at `~/.codeforge/data/`)

### Hooks

- **Per-hook disable mechanism** — add script names to `.codeforge/config/disabled-hooks.json` to disable individual hooks without disabling the entire plugin. Takes effect immediately, no restart needed.
- Disabled by default: `git-state-injector`, `ticket-linker`, `spec-reminder`, `commit-reminder`

### Scope Guard

- Fix `/dev/null` false positive — redirects to system paths (`/dev/`, `/proc/`, `/sys/`, etc.) are now allowed regardless of the primary command, not just for system commands like `git` or `pip`
- Fix CWD drift — scope root is now persisted on first invocation per session, preventing `cd` commands in Bash from silently changing the enforced scope boundary
- CWD context injector now uses the same persisted scope root, keeping advisory context aligned with enforcement
- Fix false positives blocking writes to system paths (`/dev/null`, `/usr/`, `/etc/`, `$HOME/`) — scope guard now only enforces isolation between workspace projects
- Remove complex system-command exemption logic (no longer needed)

### Dangerous Command Blocker

- Remove system directory write redirect blocks (`> /usr/`, `> /etc/`, `> /bin/`, `> /sbin/`) — caused false positives on text content in command arguments (e.g. PR body text containing paths); write location enforcement is the scope guard's responsibility

### Skills

- Added `agent-browser` skill to skill-engine plugin — guides headless browser automation with CLI reference, workflow patterns, and authentication

### Configuration

- Add `autoMemoryDirectory` setting — auto-memory now stored in project-local `.claude/memory/` instead of deep inside `~/.claude/projects/`, making it visible and version-controllable
- Enhanced system prompts with auto-memory system, hooks awareness, safety rules, and anti-over-engineering guidance

### Status Bar

- Replace `ccburn-compact` statusline widget with native `session-usage` and `weekly-usage` ccstatusline widgets — eliminates external command dependency and 8s timeout
- Comment out `ccburn` devcontainer feature (disabled by default) — functionality replaced by native widgets

### Windows Compatibility

- Fix `claude-code-native` install failure on Windows/macOS Docker Desktop — installer now falls back to `HOME` override when `su` is unavailable
- Remove `preflight.sh` runtime check — redundant with Docker's own error reporting and caused failures on Windows

### CLI Integration

- Add codeforge-cli devcontainer feature — installs the CodeForge CLI (`codeforge` command) globally via npm
- Remove dead `codeforge` alias from setup-aliases.sh (was pointing to obsolete `setup.js`)

### Testing

- **Plugin test suite** — 241 pytest tests covering 6 critical plugin scripts that previously had zero tests:
  - `block-dangerous.py` (46 tests) — all 22 dangerous command patterns with positive/negative/edge cases
  - `guard-workspace-scope.py` (40 tests) — blacklist, scope, allowlist, bash enforcement layers, primary command extraction
  - `guard-protected.py` (55 tests) — all protected file patterns (secrets, locks, keys, credentials, auth dirs)
  - `guard-protected-bash.py` (24 tests) — write target extraction and protected path integration
  - `guard-readonly-bash.py` (63 tests) — general-readonly and git-readonly modes, bypass prevention
  - `redirect-builtin-agents.py` (13 tests) — redirect mapping, passthrough, output structure
- Added `test:plugins` and `test:all` npm scripts for running plugin tests

### Documentation

- **DevContainer CLI guide** — dedicated Getting Started page for terminal-only workflows without VS Code
- **v2 Migration Guide** — path changes, automatic migration, manual steps, breaking changes, and troubleshooting
- Documented 4 previously undocumented agents in agents.md: implementer, investigator, tester, documenter
- Added missing git-workflow and prompt-snippets to configuration.md enabledPlugins example
- Added CONFIG_SOURCE_DIR deprecation note in environment variables reference
- Added cc-orc orchestrator command to first-session launch commands table
- Tabbed client-specific instructions on the installation page
- Dedicated port forwarding reference page covering VS Code auto-detect, devcontainer-bridge, and SSH tunneling
- Document `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` variable in CLAUDE.md for future plugin persistent storage

## v2.1.0 — 2026-03-13

### Spec Workflow v2 — "Spec Packages"

- **Breaking:** Replaced all 8 spec commands with 3: `/spec` (create & refine), `/build` (implement & close), `/specs` (dashboard)
- Specs are now directory-based "spec packages" with separated human and AI content:
  - `index.md` — human-facing entry point (~50-80 lines): intent, decisions, AC summary, scope
  - `context.md` — AI-facing shared context: invariants, anti-patterns, schema intent, constraints
  - `groups/*.md` — AC groups with YAML frontmatter for parallel agent decomposition
- Added Constitution support (`.specs/CONSTITUTION.md`) for project-level cross-cutting decisions
- Simplified approval model: spec-level `draft`/`approved` replaces per-requirement `[assumed]`/`[user-approved]` tagging
- AI makes obvious decisions autonomously, presents only genuine trade-offs to the human
- `[ai-decided]` workflow: AI records autonomous decisions during build for post-completion review
- Group frontmatter (`depends_on`, `files_owned`) drives automatic task decomposition for team builds
- Dropped MILESTONES.md and ROADMAP.md — replaced with simple BACKLOG.md idea parking lot
- Updated all 8 agent skill lists, system prompts, orchestrator prompt, skill-suggester, and 8 docs pages
- Ships with a complete example spec package (webhook delivery system) as reference

### CLI v0.1.0 (Experimental)

- Initial release of the `codeforge` CLI — session search, plugin management, config deployment, codebase indexing, and devcontainer management
- New `codeforge index` command group — build and search a codebase symbol index (build, search, show, stats, tree, clean)
- New `codeforge container` command group — manage devcontainers from the host (up, down, rebuild, exec, ls, shell)
- Container proxy — CLI commands auto-proxy into the running devcontainer when run from the host

## v2.0.3 — 2026-03-03

### CLI Feature

- Rewrote `codeforge-cli` devcontainer feature to use a self-bootstrapping wrapper instead of `npm install -g` — the CLI now runs directly from workspace source via `bun`, auto-installing dependencies on first use
- Removed `ccms` from `cc-tools` tool listing (replaced by `codeforge session search`)

### Workspace Scope Guard

- Fix scope guard blocking project root access from subdirectory CWDs — now detects git repository root and uses it as scope boundary

## v2.0.2 — 2026-03-02

### Security

- Workspace scope guard now resolves CWD with `os.path.realpath()` for consistent comparison with target paths, preventing false positives from symlinks and bind mounts
- Scope guard detects `.claude/worktrees/` in CWD and expands scope to project root, allowing sibling worktrees and the main project directory to remain in-scope
- Improved scope guard error messages to include resolved paths and scope root for easier debugging of false positives
- CWD context injector now references the project root when running inside a worktree

### Agent System

- Commit reminder and spec reminder now have a 5-minute per-session cooldown, preventing repeated firing in team/agent scenarios where Stop events are frequent

## v2.0.0 — 2026-02-26

### .codeforge/ Configuration System
- New `.codeforge/` directory centralizes all user-customizable configuration files
- Checksum-based modification detection preserves user changes during updates
- `codeforge config apply` CLI command deploys config files to `~/.claude/` (same as container start)
- Auto-migration from `.devcontainer/config/defaults/` to `.codeforge/config/` for existing users
- `.codeforge/.codeforge-preserve` for listing additional files to preserve during updates
- Config files moved from `.devcontainer/config/defaults/` to `.codeforge/config/`
- File manifest moved from `.devcontainer/config/file-manifest.json` to `.codeforge/file-manifest.json`
- Terminal connection scripts moved from `.devcontainer/` to `.codeforge/scripts/`
- `CONFIG_SOURCE_DIR` env var deprecated in favor of `CODEFORGE_DIR`
- `--force` updates now use checksum comparison for `.codeforge/` files (writes `.default` instead of `.codeforge-new`)
- `--reset` preserves `.codeforge/` user modifications (only `.devcontainer/` is wiped)
- v2 migration marker moved to `.codeforge/.markers/v2-migrated`
- Container start auto-migrates `.devcontainer/config/defaults/` to `.codeforge/config/` if needed
- Moved `.claude` directory from `/workspaces/.claude` to `~/.claude` (home directory)
- Added Docker named volume for persistence across rebuilds (per-instance isolation via `${devcontainerId}`)
- `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` now defaults to `~/.claude`

### System Prompts
- **Main system prompt redesigned** — reorganized from 672 to 462 lines; personality, core directives, and response guidelines at the top
- **Personality section** — communication style (casual-professional, direct, terse), humor rules, honesty approach, AuDHD-aware patterns, good/bad response examples; replaces the empty `<identity>` tag
- **Compressed specification management** — 98 to 28 lines; full template and enforcement workflow moved to loadable skills
- **Compressed code standards** — removed textbook principle recitations (SOLID, DRY/KISS/YAGNI by name); kept only concrete actionable rules
- **Browser automation** and **git worktrees** sections moved to loadable skills
- **Context-passing protocol** in orchestration — mandatory instructions for including gathered context, file paths, and constraints when spawning subagents
- Absorbed `<assumption_surfacing>` into `<core_directives>`, `<professional_objectivity>` into `<personality>`
- Deduplicated team composition examples; consolidated "no filler" instructions
- **`<git_worktrees>` section** — updated for Claude Code native worktree convention (`<repo>/.claude/worktrees/`), `EnterWorktree` tool guidance, `.worktreeinclude` documentation

### Orchestrator Mode
- **`cc-orc` alias** — new Claude Code entry point using `orchestrator-system-prompt.md` for delegation-first operation
- **`orchestrator-system-prompt.md`** — slim prompt (~250 lines) with delegation model, agent catalog, question surfacing protocol, planning gates, spec enforcement, and action safety

### Agent System
- **4 workhorse agents** — `investigator` (consolidated read-only research, sonnet), `implementer` (consolidated read-write implementation, opus/worktree), `tester` (enhanced test agent, opus/worktree), `documenter` (consolidated docs + specs, opus)
- **Question Surfacing Protocol** — all 4 workhorse agents STOP and return `## BLOCKED: Questions` on ambiguities
- **All 21 agents now have communication protocols** — read-only: "Handling Uncertainty"; write-capable: "Question Surfacing Protocol"
- **Architect agent overhaul** — anti-fluff enforcement (20+ banned patterns), team orchestration planning, complexity scaling (simple/moderate/complex), concrete edit ordering (Models→Services→Routes→Tests→Config), rollback strategy for schema/API changes, 3 new examples
- **Generalist rewritten as last-resort** — description explicitly warns when a specialist might be better
- **Investigator narrowed** — repositioned from catch-all to "cross-domain investigations spanning 2+ specialist areas"
- **Agent merges** — tester→test-writer (single test agent), doc-writer→documenter (single docs agent)
- **Bash guard hooks** added to researcher, debug-logs, perf-profiler (prevents state-changing commands in read-only agents)
- **Improved agent descriptions for routing accuracy** — trigger phrases, overlap boundaries between security-auditor/dependency-analyst, explorer/researcher
- **Resolved communication protocol contradictions** across all agent behavioral rules
- Agent count increased from 17 to 21 (4 workhorse + 17 specialist)
- Agent-system README updated with workhorse agent table, per-agent hooks, plugin structure

### Skill Engine
- **Weighted scoring** — suggestion phrases carry confidence weights (0.0–1.0) instead of binary match
- **Negative patterns** — substrings that instantly disqualify skills (prevents fastapi triggering for pydantic-ai)
- **Context guards** — low-confidence matches (< 0.6) require confirming context word
- **Ranked results capped at 3** — sorted by score then priority tier; eliminates suggestion floods
- **Priority tiers** — explicit commands (10) > technology skills (7) > patterns (5) > generic (3)
- **worktree skill** — git worktree creation, management, cleanup, `EnterWorktree` tool, `.worktreeinclude` setup

### Plugins
- **Expanded Anthropic official plugins** — added `code-review`, `feature-dev`, and `pr-review-toolkit` from `anthropics/claude-code`
- **Migrated plugin identifiers** — switched from `@claude-plugins-official` to `@anthropics/claude-code` format
- **Git workflow** — `/ship` (commit/push/PR with code review and approval) and `/pr:review` (PR review by number/URL, posts findings as comment)
- **Prompt snippets** — `/ps` command for quick behavioral mode switches (noaction, brief, plan, go, review, ship, deep, hold, recall, wait); composable (`/ps noaction brief`)

### Claude Code Installation
- **Native binary** via Anthropic's official installer (`https://claude.ai/install.sh`) replacing npm-based feature
- **Auto-updater works without root** — native binary at `~/.local/bin/claude` owned by container user
- **Post-start onboarding hook** (`99-claude-onboarding.sh`) — ensures `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` when token auth configured
- Update script captures errors to log (was discarding via `&>/dev/null`)
- Simplified to native-binary-only (removed npm fallback, `claude install` bootstrap)
- Alias resolution simplified — `_CLAUDE_BIN` resolves directly to native binary
- POSIX redirect, bash-required installer shell, quoted `${TARGET}`, directory pre-creation

### Testing
- **289 pytest tests** covering 6 critical plugin scripts (previously zero tests):
  - `block-dangerous.py` (62), `guard-workspace-scope.py` (40), `guard-protected.py` (56), `guard-protected-bash.py` (49), `guard-readonly-bash.py` (69), `redirect-builtin-agents.py` (13)
- `test:plugins` and `test:all` npm scripts
- Python plugin tests (`pytest`) added to CI pipeline (Q3-08)

### Authentication
- `CLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN` support in `.secrets` for long-lived tokens from `claude setup-token`
- Auto-creates `.credentials.json` from token on container start (idempotent)
- `CLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN` in devcontainer.json secrets declaration

### Security
- Removed environment variable injection vector in agent redirect log path (S2-01)
- Narrowed config deployment allowed destinations from `/usr/local` to `/usr/local/share` (S2-09)
- Protected files guard now fails closed on unexpected errors instead of failing open (S2-04)
- Protected-files-guard blocks `.credentials.json` modifications
- Replaced `eval` tilde expansion with `getent passwd` lookup (prevents shell injection)
- Auth token JSON-escaped before writing; credential directory with restrictive umask (700)
- `setup.js` path traversal prevention — `configApply()` validates source/destination paths

### Performance
- Commented out Rust toolchain feature — saves ~1.23 GB image size
- Commented out ccms feature (requires Rust)
- Updated Bun to latest (was pinned to 1.3.9)
- npm cache cleanup across 6 features: agent-browser, ast-grep, biome, claude-session-dashboard, lsp-servers, tree-sitter (saves ~96 MB)

### Port Forwarding
- Dynamic forwarding for all ports in VS Code (was only port 7847)
- **devcontainer-bridge (dbr)** — automatic port discovery and forwarding outside VS Code via [devcontainer-bridge](https://github.com/bradleybeddoes/devcontainer-bridge)

### Terminal & Color
- `TERM` and `COLORTERM=truecolor` in `remoteEnv` (Docker defaults to 8-color `xterm`)
- `TERM` forwards host terminal type via `${localEnv:TERM:xterm-256color}` (e.g., `xterm-kitty`)
- Terminal color defaults in managed shell block for tmux panes, `docker exec`, SSH sessions
- kitty-terminfo docs updated for `localEnv` forwarding

### Status Bar
- Distinct background colors per token widget (blue=input, magenta=output, yellow=cached, green=total)
- Bold 2-char labels (In, Ou, Ca, Tt) fused to data widgets, `rawValue: true` on model widget
- CLAUDE.md "Status Bar Widgets" section with widget properties and conventions

### Dangerous Command Blocker
- Force push block now suggests `git merge` as workaround
- Block `--force-with-lease` — all force push variants now blocked uniformly
- Block remote branch deletion (`git push origin --delete`, colon-refspec `git push origin :branch`)
- Handles prefix bypasses (`\rm`, `command rm`, `env rm`) and symbolic chmod (S2-03)
- Fixed README — error handling documented as "fails open" but code actually fails closed

### Guards
- **Allowed `.env.example` edits** — `.env.example` is no longer blocked by the `.env.*` pattern; actual secret files (`.env.local`, `.env.production`, etc.) remain protected
- Fixed greedy alternation in write-target regex — `>>` now matched before `>` (Q3-01)
- Unified write-target extraction patterns across guards — protected-files bash guard expanded from 5 to 20 patterns (C1-02)
- Multi-target command support — `rm`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `chmod`, `chown` with multiple file operands now check all targets
- Bare `git stash` (equivalent to push) now blocked in read-only mode (Q3-04)
- Fixed git global flag handling — `git -C /path stash list` no longer misidentifies the stash subcommand

### Session Context & Code Quality
- **Commit reminder** — switched to advisory (was blocking); tiered logic for meaningful changes; only fires when session modified files
- **Advisory test runner** — reads from correct tmp file prefix (`claude-cq-edited` instead of `claude-edited-files`)

### Scripts & Migration
- Replaced `setup-symlink-claude.sh` with `setup-migrate-claude.sh` (one-time migration)
- Migration script hardened — `cp -a` archive mode, marker-based idempotency, critical file verification, ownership fixup
- `.env` deprecation guard — `setup.sh` detects stale `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/workspaces/.claude`, overrides and auto-comments
- `setup.sh` `CODEFORGE_DIR` uses default-assignment (`:=`) to preserve user-defined values
- Container runtime pre-flight check — validates Docker/Podman before build, OS-specific remediation

### CI/CD & Public Repo
- **Tag-triggered release workflow** (`v*` tags only) — prevents accidental releases from version bumps in PRs
- CI workflow (Node 18, `npm test` + Biome check), CodeQL security analysis, Dependabot (weekly npm + GitHub Actions)
- Bug report + feature request templates, PR template, issue template config
- CONTRIBUTING.md, CLA.md, dual licensing notice, CI badge, SPDX headers on all 36 source files

### Bug Fixes
- Bun PATH in non-interactive shells
- ChromaTerm regex lookbehinds — PCRE2 compatibility
- CCStatusLine `CONFIG_SOURCE_DIR` deprecation guard, template directory permissions, silent copy failure reporting
- `marketplace.json` schema — plugin `source` fields changed from bare names to relative paths
- skill-engine worktree skill weighted tuples (was plain strings, caused crash)
- dangerous-command-blocker fail closed on exceptions (was fail-open)
- ticket-workflow redundant `ValueError` removed
- workspace-scope-guard maxsplit in variable assignment detection
- Shell scripts — executable bit on `check-setup.sh`, quoted `PLUGIN_BLACKLIST`, `set -uo pipefail` in tmux installer, `command -v` replacing deprecated `which`, normalized `&>` redirects
- `implementer.md` — PostToolUse hook changed to Stop hook with 120s timeout
- `tester.md` — Stop hook timeout 30s→120s
- Stale merge conflict marker in first-session docs

### Documentation
- **DevContainer CLI guide** — dedicated Getting Started page for terminal-only workflows
- **v2 Migration Guide** — path changes, automatic migration, manual steps, breaking changes, troubleshooting
- **Ported `.devcontainer/docs/` to docs site** — Keybindings page, Troubleshooting page (12+ entries), Optional Features page, merged env vars and .secrets docs
- Versioned docs infrastructure (starlight-versions plugin)
- Fixed docs site URL to `https://codeforge.core-directive.com` (custom domain, no base path)
- Replaced `anexileddev.github.io/CodeForge/` URLs with custom domain across all files
- README: "Why CodeForge?" section, architecture overview, configuration summary
- Agent/skill/plugin count updates (21 agents, 38 skills, 14 plugins) across all docs pages
- Missing plugin pages for git-workflow and prompt-snippets
- Port Forwarding reference, CLI guide cross-link, slimmed Installation page
- Documented 4 workhorse agents, cc-orc command, CONFIG_SOURCE_DIR deprecation, CLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN setup
- Added missing git-workflow and prompt-snippets to configuration.md enabledPlugins example
- Tabbed client-specific instructions on the installation page
- MD040 compliance (language specifiers on fenced code blocks)
- Architecture docs — `.checksums/` and `.markers/` in `.codeforge/` tree
- Troubleshooting — "Reset to Defaults" renamed to "How to Reset", clarified `--reset` behavior
- Removed `.devcontainer/docs/` directory (all content migrated to docs site)
- All docs reference `~/.claude` as default config path

### Removed
- `setup-symlink-claude.sh` — replaced by `setup-migrate-claude.sh`
- **Todo+** VS Code extension (`fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus`)

## v1.14.2

**Release date:** 2026-02-24

### Added

#### Prompt Snippets Plugin
- **New plugin: `prompt-snippets`** — single `/ps` slash command for quick behavioral mode switches (noaction, brief, plan, go, review, ship, deep, hold, recall, wait)
- Snippets inject short directives that persist for the conversation (e.g., `/ps noaction` → "Investigate and report only. Take no action.")
- Composable: `/ps noaction brief` applies multiple snippets at once
- Isolated from skill-engine auto-suggestion (`disable-model-invocation: true`) and independently toggleable via `enabledPlugins`

### Changed

#### Docs
- **First Session page** — trimmed from 198 to 128 lines by consolidating "What Happens Automatically" into a concise summary, replacing full agent/skill tables with brief teasers linking to their dedicated pages
- **Installation Troubleshooting** — expanded from 4 to 10 FAQ entries covering `npx` failures, VS Code extension issues, Docker permissions on Linux, WSL 2 integration, port conflicts, and slow rebuilds

### Fixed

#### CI: Release Workflow (v1.14.1)
- **test.js** — settings.json path updated from `config/settings.json` to `config/defaults/settings.json` to match config externalization refactor
- **test.js** — Test 5 (executable check) result now included in exit condition; previously a failure was logged but did not affect the exit code
- **setup.js** — file permissions changed from 644 to 755 (executable) to match shebang and `bin` declaration in package.json

#### CI: Publish DevContainer Features Workflow (v1.14.1)
- **features/README.md** — removed from features directory; `devcontainers/action@v1` treated it as a feature subdirectory and failed looking for `README.md/devcontainer-feature.json`
- **11 devcontainer-feature.json files** — removed `"maintainer"` field (not in the DevContainer Feature spec schema, causing strict validation failure): ast-grep, ccburn, ccms, ccstatusline, ccusage, chromaterm, claude-monitor, claude-session-dashboard, lsp-servers, mcp-qdrant, tree-sitter

#### CI: Publish DevContainer Features Workflow (v1.14.2)
- **6 devcontainer-feature.json files** — removed `"proposals"` field that coexisted with `"enum"` on the same option (spec schema treats them as mutually exclusive via `anyOf`): ccburn, ccusage, claude-monitor, claude-session-dashboard, mcp-qdrant, tree-sitter

#### Docs
- **Active sidebar item** — increased background opacity from 0.08 to 0.14, added `font-weight: 600` and `color: var(--sl-color-accent-high)` for readable contrast against inactive items
- **Stale skill counts** — 5 pages (First Session, Getting Started index, Features index) referenced "21 skills" instead of the correct total of 34 across all plugins (skill-engine: 21, spec-workflow: 8, ticket-workflow: 4, agent-system: 1)

## v1.14.0

**Release date:** 2026-02-24

### Fixed (CodeRabbit review)
- **chromaterm/install.sh** — username auto-detection now resets to empty before candidate loop, so `${USERNAME:-root}` fallback works correctly
- **biome/install.sh** — nvm.sh sourcing wrapped in `set +u` / `set -u` to prevent unbound variable abort under `set -euo pipefail`
- **setup.js** — `ccstatusline-settings.json` added to DEFAULT_PRESERVE so user customizations survive `--force` package updates
- **docs agent-system.md** — spec-writer moved from Full-Access to Read-Only agents table (matches its `permissionMode: plan` definition)
- **guard-readonly-bash.py** — docstring corrected from "Returns JSON on stdout" to "Outputs block reason to stderr"
- **git-forensics/SKILL.md** — misleading "Blame through renames" comment fixed to "Show patch history through renames"

### Added

#### Nuclear Workspace Scope Enforcement
- **Blacklist system** — `/workspaces/.devcontainer/` permanently blocked for ALL operations (read, write, bash). Checked before allowlist, scope check, and cwd bypass. Cannot be overridden, even from workspace root
- **Bash enforcement** — two-layer detection in `guard-workspace-scope.py`:
  - Layer 1: 20+ regex patterns extract write targets (`>`, `tee`, `cp`, `mv`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `ln`, `rsync`, `chmod`, `chown`, `dd`, `wget -O`, `curl -o`, `tar -C`, `unzip -d`, `gcc -o`, `sqlite3`). System command exemption only when ALL targets resolve to system paths
  - Layer 2: regex scans entire command for any `/workspaces/` path string — catches inline scripts, variable assignments, quoted paths. No exemptions, always runs
- **CWD context injector** (`inject-workspace-cwd.py`) — fires on SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, SubagentStart to reinforce working directory scope
- **Fail-closed error handling** — JSON parse errors, exceptions, and unknown tools now exit 2 (block) instead of exit 0 (allow)

#### Agent System Enhancements
- **`task-completed-check.py`** — quality gate hook (TaskCompleted) runs test suite before allowing task completion
- **`teammate-idle-check.py`** — quality gate hook (TeammateIdle) prevents teammates from going idle with incomplete tasks
- **`skills/debug/SKILL.md`** — structured log investigation skill replacing the old `/debug` slash command
- **`permissionMode`** declared on all 17 agent definitions (plan for read-only, default for write-capable)
- **Agent-system README** — full plugin documentation with hook lifecycle, agent table, quality gates

#### Skill Engine Enhancements
- **6 new skill matchers** in `skill-suggester.py`: `spec-check`, `spec-init`, `spec-new`, `spec-refine`, `spec-update`, `team`
- **Team skill expanded** (v0.2.0) — quality gate hooks, plan approval workflow, keyboard shortcuts, use case examples, best practices, limitations
- **Skill-engine README** — full plugin documentation

#### New Features
- **chromaterm** — terminal output colorizer via ChromaTerm2 YAML rules
- **kitty-terminfo** — xterm-kitty terminfo for Kitty terminal compatibility

#### Documentation Site
- **Astro/Starlight docs** (`docs/`) — full documentation portal with getting-started guides, plugin reference (12 pages), feature docs, customization, and API reference
- **GitHub Actions** — `deploy-docs.yml` (docs deployment), `publish-features.yml` (GHCR feature publishing), `release.yml` (release workflow)

#### ccstatusline Config Externalization
- **Widget config extracted** from inline `jq -n` generation in `install.sh` into `config/defaults/ccstatusline-settings.json` — editable JSON file, single source of truth
- **File-manifest deployment** — two new entries deploy the config to `~/.config/ccstatusline/settings.json` (if-changed) and `/usr/local/share/ccstatusline/settings.template.json` (always)

- **`skill-engine` plugin** — 21 coding skills with auto-suggestion hook
- **`spec-workflow` plugin** — 8 spec lifecycle skills with spec-reminder hook
- **`session-context` plugin** — session boundary hooks (git state injection, TODO harvesting, commit reminders)

#### Other
- **`ticket-workflow` hooks** — auto-links GitHub issue/PR references in user prompts via `ticket-linker.py`
- **`auto-code-quality` advisory test runner** — runs affected tests at Stop via `advisory-test-runner.py`
- **`/team` skill** — agent team creation and management with specialist catalog (in `skill-engine`)
- **`claude-session-dashboard` feature** — local analytics dashboard for Claude Code sessions (token usage, tool calls, cost estimates, activity heatmaps). Installed globally via npm with `claude-dashboard` command. Settings persist across rebuilds via symlink to `/workspaces/.claude-dashboard/`

### Changed

- Plugin architecture: `code-directive` monolith replaced by focused plugins (`agent-system`, `skill-engine`, `spec-workflow`, `session-context`)
- `auto-code-quality` now consolidates `auto-formatter` + `auto-linter` (disabled separately, `auto-code-quality` is the superset)

### Removed

- `code-directive` plugin (replaced by `agent-system`, `skill-engine`, `spec-workflow`, `session-context`)
- `auto-formatter` and `auto-linter` disabled in settings (consolidated into `auto-code-quality`)

---

## v1.12.0

**Release date:** 2026-02-18

### Added

#### Plugin README Documentation
- **9 new README files** for all marketplace plugins: auto-formatter, auto-linter, code-directive, codeforge-lsp, dangerous-command-blocker, notify-hook, protected-files-guard, ticket-workflow, workspace-scope-guard. Each documents purpose, hook lifecycle, protected patterns, and plugin structure

#### Protected Files Guard: Bash Hook
- **`guard-protected-bash.py`** — new PreToolUse/Bash hook blocking bash commands that write to protected file paths (companion to existing Edit/Write guard). Covers `>`, `>>`, `tee`, `cp`, `mv`, `sed -i` targeting `.env`, lock files, `.git`, certificates, and credentials

#### Devcontainer Secrets Declaration
- **`secrets` block** in devcontainer.json declaring `GH_TOKEN`, `NPM_TOKEN`, `GH_USERNAME`, `GH_EMAIL` with documentation URLs for VS Code Codespaces/devcontainer secret management

#### Post-Start Hook System
- **`run_poststart_hooks()`** in setup.sh — runs executable `.sh` scripts from `/usr/local/devcontainer-poststart.d/`; controlled by `SETUP_POSTSTART` env flag (default: true)

#### Git Worktree Support
- **System prompt `<git_worktrees>` section** — layout convention, creation commands, project detection, and safety rules
- **CLAUDE.md documentation** — full worktree section with layout, creation, detection, and compatibility details
- **setup-projects.sh** — `.worktrees/` explicit scanning at depth 3, `.git` file detection via `gitdir:` check, `"worktree"` tag in Project Manager
- **protected-files-guard** — `.git` regex updated from `\.git/` to `\.git(/|$)` to cover worktree `.git` pointer files

#### Other

- **Go runtime option** — commented-out `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/go:1` entry in devcontainer.json for easy opt-in

### Changed

#### Feature Version Pinning
- All local features pinned from `"latest"` to explicit versions: agent-browser `0.11.1`, ast-grep `0.40.5`, biome `2.4.2`, ruff `0.15.1`, pyright `1.1.408`, typescript-language-server `5.1.3`, TypeScript `5.9.3`
- External features pinned to minor versions: node `1.6`, github-cli `1.0`, docker-outside-of-docker `1.7`, uv `1.0`, rust `1.4`, claude-code `1.1`

#### Default Shell: bash → zsh
- VS Code terminal default profile changed from bash to zsh
- Explicit `zsh` profile added to terminal profile list
- Claude Teams tmux profile shell changed from bash to zsh

#### Security Hardening
- **dangerous-command-blocker** — 7 new blocked patterns: Docker container escape (`--privileged`, host root mount), destructive Docker ops (`stop/rm/kill/rmi`), bare force push (no branch specified), `find -exec rm`, `find -delete`, `git clean -f`, `rm -rf ../`. JSON parse failures now fail closed (exit 2 instead of 0)
- **protected-files-guard** — JSON parse failures fail closed (exit 2 instead of 0)

#### Build & Setup
- **ccms build cache** — install.sh checks `.build-cache/bin/ccms` before cargo building; caches binary after first build for faster rebuilds; pinned to commit `f90d259a4476`
- **setup.sh** — `setup-update-claude.sh` now runs in background (non-blocking container start); script failure output displayed for diagnostics; new `background` status indicator in summary
- **inotify-tools moved to build time** — tmux feature installs inotify-tools via apt at build; setup-projects.sh no longer attempts runtime apt-get install
- **Container memory** — recommended from 4GB/8GB to 6GB/12GB in troubleshooting docs

#### Writing System Prompt
- New **Emotional Architecture** section — cognitive-emotional loop, controlled emotion principle, autism framing for POV characters
- Expanded metaphor guidance — secondary sources beyond primary domain, "would he think this?" test
- Refined show-don't-tell rules — naming emotion permitted when it adds weight, brief internal processing after major events required
- Character profile additions — emotional architecture and trigger fields

#### Other
- **connect-external-terminal.ps1** — tmux session directory respects `WORKSPACE_ROOT` env var with fallback
- **setup-projects.sh** — inotifywait exclude pattern narrowed from `\.git/` to `\.git` for worktree compatibility
- **README.md** — 5 new badges (changelog, last commit, npm downloads, Node.js, issues), updated tool/feature/skill counts, added Rust/Bun/ccw, changelog section
- **CLAUDE.md** — expanded ccw description, fixed Bun registry reference, documented setup-auth.sh/check-setup.sh, added CLAUDECODE/env flags/experimental vars/git worktrees/rules system sections, skill count 17→28
- **Documentation** — `SETUP_TERMINAL`/`SETUP_POSTSTART` in configuration reference, `CLAUDECODE=null` env var, workspace-scope-guard in plugins.md
- **Agent definitions** — minor path/prompt fixes across 8 agents (claude-guide, debug-logs, dependency-analyst, explorer, generalist, git-archaeologist, researcher, security-auditor)
- **.gitignore** — added `.build-cache/` exclusion

### Removed

- **mcp-reasoner feature** — entire feature directory deleted (README, devcontainer-feature.json, install.sh, poststart-hook.sh)
- **splitrail feature** — entire feature directory deleted (README, devcontainer-feature.json, install.sh)

---

## v1.11.0

**Release date:** 2026-02-17

### Added

#### New Feature: ccms (Session History Search)
- **`ccms` devcontainer feature** — Rust-based CLI for searching Claude Code session JSONL files. Installed via `cargo install`. Supports boolean queries, role filtering, time scoping, project isolation, and JSON output
- **`session-search.md` rule** — global rule requiring project-scoped `ccms` usage and documenting CLI flags/query syntax
- **Rust runtime** — added `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/rust:1` as a devcontainer feature (required by ccms)
- **System prompt `<session_search>` section** — inline reference for ccms usage with key flags and examples
- **Context management updated** — `<context_management>` now references ccms as the primary recovery tool for compacted sessions (three-source recovery: session history → source files → plan/requirement files)

#### New Feature: ccw (Writing Mode)
- **`ccw` alias** — launches Claude with `writing-system-prompt.md` for creative-writing tasks
- **`writing-system-prompt.md`** — dedicated system prompt for writing mode, distributed via file-manifest

#### New Plugin: workspace-scope-guard
- **`workspace-scope-guard`** — safety plugin that blocks writes and warns on reads outside the working directory. Registered in marketplace.json and enabled by default in settings.json

#### New Skills: spec-build, spec-review (code-directive plugin — 28 skills total)
- **`/spec-build`** — orchestrates the full implementation lifecycle from an approved spec: plan, build, review, and close in one pass. 5-phase workflow with acceptance criteria markers (`[ ]` → `[~]` → `[x]`)
- **`/spec-review`** — standalone deep implementation review against a spec. Reads code, verifies requirements and acceptance criteria, recommends `/spec-update` when done

#### New Hook: inject-cwd.py
- **`inject-cwd.py`** (PostToolUse, all tools) — injects current working directory into every tool response via `additionalContext`

#### Status Line: CWD Widget
- **`ccstatusline-cwd`** — new custom-command widget showing the basename of Claude Code's working directory. Layout expanded from 7 to 8 lines (16 → 17 widgets)

### Changed

#### setup-aliases.sh Idempotency Fix
- **Block-marker strategy** — replaced cleanup+guard approach (which left aliases missing on re-run) with a delete-and-rewrite strategy using `START`/`END` block markers. The managed block is removed wholesale by sed range match, then always re-written fresh — no guard/`continue` needed
- **Legacy cleanup expanded** — added removal of v1.10.0 orphaned aliases/exports/`_CLAUDE_BIN`/`cc-tools()` that existed outside block markers, in addition to pre-v1.10.0 function forms
- **cc-tools expanded** — added `ccw`, `ccms`, `cargo` to the tool listing

#### Spec Workflow: Version-Based → Domain-Based Organization
- **Directory structure** — specs now live in domain subfolders (`.specs/{domain}/{feature}.md`) instead of version directories (`.specs/v0.1.0/feature.md`)
- **ROADMAP.md → MILESTONES.md** — version tracker renamed to milestone tracker throughout all skills, templates, and system prompt
- **`**Version:**` → `**Domain:**`** — spec template metadata field renamed across spec-new template, spec-writer agent, specification-writing skill, spec-update, spec-check
- **`roadmap-template.md` → `milestones-template.md`** — reference template replaced
- **Acceptance criteria markers** — three-state progress tracking: `[ ]` (not started), `[~]` (implemented, not yet verified), `[x]` (verified). Used by `/spec-build` phases and recognized by `/spec-check` and `/spec-update`
- **Spec lifecycle expanded** — `/spec-review` inserted before `/spec-update` in the recommended post-implementation workflow. `spec-reminder.py` advisory message updated accordingly
- **Agent skill lists** — architect, generalist, and spec-writer agents gained `/spec-review` access

#### LSP Plugin: Declarative Server Configuration
- **`codeforge-lsp/plugin.json`** — added `lspServers` block with pyright (Python), typescript-language-server (JS/TS), and gopls (Go) declarative configurations replacing implicit setup

#### git-state-injector.py Enhancements
- **Working directory injection** — always outputs cwd with scope restriction message, even outside git repos
- **cwd from hook input** — reads `cwd` from Claude Code's hook JSON input (falls back to `os.getcwd()`)

#### System Prompt Formatting
- **Line unwrapping** — long wrapped lines consolidated to single lines throughout (no content changes, only formatting)

#### Documentation
- **CLAUDE.md** — added `ccw`, `ccms` commands; added `writing-system-prompt.md` to directory tree and config table; added workspace-scope-guard to plugin list; skill count 17 → 28; added Rust to `version: "none"` support; updated setup-aliases.sh description
- **README.md** — added Safety Plugins section; updated spec workflow commands/lifecycle/structure for domain-based organization; added `/spec-build` and `/spec-review` to skill table; fixed system prompt override path (`system-prompt.md` → `main-system-prompt.md`)
- **claude-guide agent** — fixed system prompt path reference (`system-prompt.md` → `main-system-prompt.md`)
- **doc-writer agent** — "Version ships" → "Milestone ships" terminology
- **marketplace.json** — skill count updated (16 → 28); workspace-scope-guard added
- **skill-suggester.py** — added keyword mappings for `spec-build` and `spec-review`
- **spec-workflow.md rule** — added `/spec-build` and `/spec-review` rules (#10, #11); added acceptance criteria markers section; updated directory convention to domain-based

### Removed

- **`spec-init/references/roadmap-template.md`** — replaced by `milestones-template.md`

---

## v1.10.0

**Release date:** 2026-02-13

### Added

#### New Skill: spec-refine (code-directive plugin — 26 skills total)
- **`/spec-refine`** — iterative 6-phase spec refinement: assumption mining, requirement validation (`[assumed]` → `[user-approved]`), acceptance criteria review, scope audit, and final approval gate

#### setup-terminal.sh
- New setup script configures VS Code Shift+Enter keybinding for Claude Code multi-line terminal input (idempotent, merges into existing keybindings.json)

### Changed

#### Native Binary Preference
- **setup-aliases.sh** — introduces `_CLAUDE_BIN` variable resolution: prefers `~/.local/bin/claude` (official `claude install` location), falls back to `/usr/local/bin/claude`, then PATH. All aliases (`cc`, `claude`, `ccraw`) use `"$_CLAUDE_BIN"`
- **setup-update-claude.sh** — complete rewrite: delegates to `claude install` (first run) and `claude update` (subsequent starts) instead of manual binary download/checksum/swap. Logs to `/tmp/claude-update.log`

#### Smart Test Selection
- **advisory-test-runner.py** — rewritten to run only affected tests based on edited files. Maps source files to test files (pytest directory mirroring, vitest `--related`, jest `--findRelatedTests`, Go package mapping). Timeout reduced from 60s to 15s. Skips entirely if no files edited
- **hooks.json** — advisory-test-runner timeout reduced from 65s to 20s

#### Two-Level Project Detection
- **setup-projects.sh** — two-pass scanning: depth-1 directories with project markers registered directly; directories without markers treated as containers and children scanned. Recursive inotifywait with noise exclusion. Clean process group shutdown

#### Spec Approval Workflow
- **spec-writer agent** — adds `**Approval:** draft` field, requires `[assumed]` tagging on all requirements, adds `## Resolved Questions` section, references `/spec-refine` before implementation
- **spec-new skill** — pre-fills `**Approval:** draft`, notes features should come from backlog
- **spec-check skill** — adds Unapproved (high) and Assumed Requirements (medium) issue checks, Approval column in health table, approval summary
- **spec-update skill** — minor alignment with approval workflow
- **spec-init templates** — backlog template expanded with P0–P3 priority grades + Infrastructure section; roadmap template rewritten with pull-from-backlog workflow
- **specification-writing skill** — updated with approval field and requirement tagging guidance

#### Spec Workflow Completeness
- **spec-workflow.md (global rule)** — softened 200-line hard cap to "aim for ~200"; added approval workflow rules (spec-refine gate, requirement tags, spec-reminder hook); added `**Approval:**` and `## Resolved Questions` to standard template
- **main-system-prompt.md** — softened 4× hard "≤200 lines" references to "~200 lines"
- **spec-new skill** — fixed "capped at 200" internal contradiction; added explanation of what `/spec-refine` does and why
- **spec-new template** — added Approval Workflow section explaining `[assumed]`/`[user-approved]` tags and `draft`/`user-approved` status
- **spec-update skill** — added approval gate warning for draft specs; added spec-reminder hook documentation; added approval validation to checklist
- **spec-check skill** — added `implemented + draft` (High) and `inconsistent approval` (High) checks
- **spec-init skill** — expanded next-steps with full lifecycle (backlog → roadmap → spec → refine → implement → update → check)
- **spec-reminder.py** — added `/spec-refine` mention in advisory message for draft specs

#### Documentation Sizing
- **Relaxed 200-line hard cap** to "aim for ~200 lines" across global rule, system prompt, spec-new skill, architect agent, doc-writer agent, documentation-patterns skill, and spec-check skill

#### Other
- **setup.sh** — added `SETUP_TERMINAL` flag, normalized update-claude invocation via `run_script` helper
- **check-setup.sh** — removed checks for disabled features (shfmt, shellcheck, hadolint, dprint); checks RC files for alias instead of `type cc`
- **connect-external-terminal.sh** — uses `${WORKSPACE_ROOT:-/workspaces}` instead of hardcoded path
- **devcontainer.json** — formatting normalization
- **main-system-prompt.md** — updates for spec approval workflow and requirement tagging

### Removed
- **test-project/README.md** — deleted (no longer needed)

---

## v1.9.0

**Release date:** 2026-02-10

### Added

#### Agent Context Inheritance (code-directive plugin)
- **Project Context Discovery** — all 14 project-interacting agents now read `.claude/rules/*.md` and CLAUDE.md files before starting work. Agents walk up the directory tree from their working directory to the workspace root, applying conventions from each level (deeper files take precedence)
- **Execution Discipline** — 7 agents (generalist, refactorer, migrator, test-writer, doc-writer, architect, researcher) gain structured pre/post-work verification: read before writing, verify after writing, no silent deviations, failure diagnosis before retry
- **Code Standards** — 5 agents (generalist full; refactorer, migrator, test-writer, architect compact) gain SOLID, DRY/KISS/YAGNI, function size limits, error handling rules, and forbidden patterns (god classes, magic numbers, dead code)
- **Professional Objectivity** — 10 agents gain explicit instruction to prioritize technical accuracy over agreement, present evidence when it conflicts with assumptions
- **Communication Standards** — all 14 agents gain response brevity rules: substance-first responses, no preamble, explicit uncertainty marking, file:line references
- **Documentation Convention** — 2 write agents (generalist, migrator) gain inline comment guidance (explain "why", not "what")
- **Context Management** — generalist gains instruction to continue working normally when context runs low
- **Testing Guidance** — generalist gains testing standards (verify behavior not implementation, max 3 mocks per test)
- **Scope Discipline** — refactorer gains explicit constraint: never expand scope beyond the requested refactoring
- **Tiered approach**: Tier 1 (generalist, 139→268 lines, all blocks), Tier 2 (4 write agents, full blocks), Tier 3 (9 read-only agents, compact blocks). 3 agents skipped (bash-exec, claude-guide, statusline-config — no project context needed)

#### Specification Workflow System (code-directive plugin — 4 new skills, 25 total)
- **`/spec-new`** — creates a new spec from the standard template in `.specs/`
- **`/spec-update`** — performs as-built spec update after implementation (checks off criteria, adds implementation notes, updates paths)
- **`/spec-check`** — audits spec health: stale specs, missing coverage, orphaned files
- **`/spec-init`** — bootstraps `.specs/` directory structure for projects that don't have one
- **`spec-reminder.py`** `[Stop]` — new advisory hook reminds about spec updates when implementation work is detected
- **Spec skills assigned to agents** — generalist and spec-writer agents gain spec skill access in frontmatter

#### Default Rules Distribution
- **`config/defaults/rules/`** — new directory containing default `.claude/rules/` files distributed to all projects via file-manifest
- **`spec-workflow.md`** — rule enforcing spec-before-implementation workflow, ≤200 line spec limit, `.specs/` directory convention, as-built update requirement
- **`workspace-scope.md`** — rule restricting file operations to the current project directory

#### New Plugin: auto-code-quality
- **Self-contained code quality plugin** — combines auto-formatter + auto-linter into a single drop-in plugin with independent temp file namespace (`claude-cq-*`). Includes all 7 formatters (Ruff, Biome, gofmt, shfmt, dprint, rustfmt, Black fallback) and 7 linters (Pyright, Ruff, Biome, ShellCheck, go vet, hadolint, clippy) plus syntax validation. Designed for use outside the CodeForge devcontainer where auto-formatter and auto-linter aren't available separately

### Changed

#### Config System
- **`file-manifest.json`** — added 2 new entries for default rules files (`defaults/rules/spec-workflow.md`, `defaults/rules/workspace-scope.md`) targeting `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/rules`
- **`setup-config.sh` bug fix** — fixed bash field-collapse bug where empty `destFilename` caused subsequent fields to shift. Uses `__NONE__` sentinel in jq output to prevent `read` from collapsing consecutive tab delimiters

#### Plugin References
- **`frontend-design` plugin name corrected** — fixed `frontend-design@claude-code-plugins` → `frontend-design@claude-plugins-official` in both `settings.json` and `CLAUDE.md`

#### Code-Directive Plugin
- **`hooks.json`** — added `spec-reminder.py` to Stop hooks (now 3 Stop hooks: advisory-test-runner, commit-reminder, spec-reminder)
- **`marketplace.json`** — added `auto-code-quality` plugin entry (10 plugins total, was 9)
- **Agent definitions** — 14 of 17 agents updated with orchestrator-mirrored instructions (see Agent Context Inheritance above)

#### Formatting
- **Whitespace normalization** — `settings.json`, `file-manifest.json`, `marketplace.json`, `hooks.json`, `package.json`, `setup-config.sh` reformatted to consistent tab indentation

---

## v1.8.0

**Release date:** 2026-02-09

### Added

#### Config System: Declarative File Manifest
- **`config/file-manifest.json`** — new declarative manifest controlling which config files are copied and how. Replaces hardcoded `copy_file` calls with per-file `overwrite` modes: `"if-changed"` (sha256-based, default), `"always"`, or `"never"`
- **`config/defaults/`** — config files relocated from `config/` to `config/defaults/` (settings.json, keybindings.json, main-system-prompt.md)
- **`setup-config.sh` rewritten** — reads file-manifest.json, supports variable expansion (`${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}`, `${WORKSPACE_ROOT}`), sha256-based change detection, and legacy fallback if manifest is missing

#### Features
- **ruff feature** — Python formatter/linter via `uv tool install ruff`; replaces Black as primary Python formatter (Black kept as fallback)
- **shfmt feature** — Shell script formatter via direct binary download from GitHub releases; supports `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.mksh`, `.bats`
- **dprint feature** — Pluggable formatter for Markdown, YAML, TOML, and Dockerfile via GitHub releases binary; ships global config at `/usr/local/share/dprint/dprint.json` with four plugins (markdown, yaml, toml, dockerfile)
- **shellcheck feature** — Shell script linter via `apt-get install`; JSON output parsing for structured diagnostics
- **hadolint feature** — Dockerfile linter via direct binary download from GitHub releases; JSON output parsing

#### Formatter Coverage (format-on-stop.py)
- **Ruff formatter** — `.py`/`.pyi` files now formatted with Ruff (falls back to Black if Ruff not installed)
- **Biome expanded** — added `.css`, `.json`, `.jsonc`, `.graphql`, `.gql`, `.html`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, `.astro` (was JS/TS only; now 18 extensions total)
- **shfmt integration** — `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.mksh`, `.bats` files auto-formatted on Stop
- **dprint integration** — `.md`, `.markdown`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.toml` files and `Dockerfile`/`.dockerfile` auto-formatted on Stop
- **rustfmt integration** — `.rs` files auto-formatted if `rustfmt` is in PATH (conditional, zero overhead when unused)

#### Linter Coverage (lint-file.py)
- **Ruff linter** — Python files now checked by both Pyright (type checking) and Ruff (style/correctness); complementary, not redundant
- **Biome lint** — JS/TS/CSS/GraphQL files linted via `biome lint --reporter=json`; surfaces unsafe diagnostics not auto-fixed by formatter
- **ShellCheck** — shell scripts linted via `shellcheck --format=json`; structured severity/line/message output
- **go vet** — `.go` files linted via `go vet`; stderr parsed for diagnostics
- **hadolint** — `Dockerfile`/`.dockerfile` files linted via `hadolint --format json`
- **clippy** — `.rs` files linted via `cargo clippy` if cargo is in PATH (conditional)

#### version:none Support
- **All 20 local features** now support `"version": "none"` in devcontainer.json to skip installation entirely
- Added `version` option to 7 features that previously lacked it: ccstatusline, notify-hook, shellcheck, mcp-qdrant, mcp-reasoner, splitrail, lsp-servers
- Added skip guard (`if [ "${VERSION}" = "none" ]; then exit 0; fi`) to all 20 install.sh files

#### Advisory Hooks (code-directive plugin)
- **advisory-test-runner.py** `[Stop]` — runs project test suite on Stop, injects pass/fail results as `additionalContext`. Never blocks (always exit 0). Detects pytest, vitest, jest, mocha, go test, cargo test. 60s timeout, truncates to last 30 lines
- **git-state-injector.py** `[SessionStart]` — injects branch, status summary, recent commits, and diff stats as `additionalContext` on every session start. 5s per git command, total output capped at 2000 chars
- **ticket-linker.py** `[UserPromptSubmit]` — auto-fetches GitHub issues/PRs when prompt contains `#123` or full GitHub URLs. Up to 3 refs per prompt, body capped at 1500 chars each
- **commit-reminder.py** `[Stop]` — checks for uncommitted changes (staged/unstaged counts) and injects advisory reminder as `additionalContext`. Checks `stop_hook_active`
- **todo-harvester.py** `[SessionStart]` — greps for TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX across 13 source extensions, injects count + top 10 items. Excludes noise dirs, output capped at 800 chars

#### New Skills (code-directive plugin — 5 new, 21 total)
- **api-design** — REST conventions, error handling patterns, OpenAPI/Swagger guidance
- **ast-grep-patterns** — structural code search patterns across languages
- **dependency-management** — ecosystem-specific audit commands, license compliance
- **documentation-patterns** — docstring formats, API doc templates
- **migration-patterns** — Python and JavaScript framework migration guides

#### Commands & Scripts
- **`cc-tools`** — new shell function listing all installed CodeForge tools with version info
- **`check-setup`** — new health check script (`check-setup.sh`) verifying container setup is working correctly; aliased in shell rc files

#### Workspace
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — workspace-level project instructions (workspace scoping rules)
- **`test-project/`** — minimal test project directory

### Changed

#### NPM Package (setup.js)
- **`--force` is now non-destructive** — selectively syncs files instead of rm+copy. Framework files (scripts, features, plugins) are overwritten; user config files (settings, keybindings, system prompt, file-manifest) are preserved with `.codeforge-new` versions saved for diffing
- **`--reset` flag** — new option for complete fresh install (deletes and re-copies everything)
- **`.codeforge-preserve`** — user-customizable file listing additional paths to preserve during `--force` updates
- **devcontainer.json handling** — user's version backed up as `.bak` during `--force`, then overwritten with package version
- **`.npmignore`** — excludes `.codeforge-new`, `.bak`, and `.codeforge-preserve` artifacts from npm package

#### Setup System
- **setup.sh** — removed `set -e` (individual script failures no longer abort the entire setup); structured pass/fail/skip reporting with elapsed time summary
- **setup-aliases.sh** — backs up `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` before modifying (keeps last 3 backups); cleans up old cc-tools/check-setup definitions; adds `cc-tools` function and `check-setup` alias
- **OVERWRITE_CONFIG deprecated** — replaced by per-file `overwrite` in `config/file-manifest.json`. Legacy env var triggers a deprecation warning

#### Code-Directive Plugin
- **hooks.json** — expanded from 3 to 6 hook events (added Stop, SessionStart, updated UserPromptSubmit with ticket-linker)
- **Agent definitions** — architect gains documentation outputs section + api-design skill link; multiple agents updated with refined instructions
- **skill-suggester.py** — added keyword mappings for 5 new skills (api-design, ast-grep-patterns, dependency-management, documentation-patterns, migration-patterns)
- **specification-writing skill** — expanded with additional templates and patterns
- **code-directive plugin.json** — description updated to "17 custom agents, 16 coding skills, agent redirection, syntax validation, and skill auto-suggestion"

#### Other
- **format-on-stop.py** — rewritten with expanded dispatch: 7 formatters covering 31 file extensions (was 3 formatters, 12 extensions)
- **lint-file.py** — rewritten as multi-language dispatcher: 7 linters across Python, JS/TS/CSS, Shell, Go, Dockerfile, Rust (was Pyright-only for Python)
- **auto-linter hook timeout** — increased from 30s to 60s (each individual linter subprocess still capped at 10s)
- **auto-formatter plugin.json** — description updated to reflect all 7 formatters
- **auto-linter plugin.json** — description updated to reflect all 7 linters
- **marketplace.json** — descriptions updated for auto-formatter, auto-linter, and code-directive plugins
- **devcontainer.json** — 5 new features registered in `overrideFeatureInstallOrder` and `features` object; added install order documentation comments
- **.env.example** — removed `OVERWRITE_CONFIG`, added `SETUP_PROJECTS`, updated descriptions
- **.gitignore** — updated with additional exclusions

### Removed

- **`features/claude-code/`** — entire local feature deleted (Claude Code now installed via `ghcr.io/anthropics/devcontainer-features/claude-code:1`, the official Anthropic feature)
- **`config/settings.json`**, **`config/keybindings.json`**, **`config/main-system-prompt.md`** — moved to `config/defaults/` subdirectory
- **`OVERWRITE_CONFIG` env var** — deprecated in favor of `config/file-manifest.json` per-file overwrite modes

### Documentation

- **New `docs/` directory** with 5 focused guides: configuration-reference, keybindings, optional-features, plugins, troubleshooting
- **CLAUDE.md** — rewritten for new config system (file-manifest.json, config/defaults/), added cc-tools/check-setup commands, added version:none section, updated plugin descriptions
- **README.md** — added new tools (ruff, shfmt, dprint, shellcheck, hadolint, Bun), updated config system docs, added SETUP_PROJECTS and PLUGIN_BLACKLIST env vars, updated ccstatusline description

---

## v1.7.1

**Release date:** 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Automatic Git & NPM auth on container start** — new `setup-auth.sh` script reads tokens from `.devcontainer/.secrets` (or environment variables) and configures GitHub CLI, git user identity, and NPM registry auth automatically
- **`.secrets.example` template** — committed template showing required variables (`GH_TOKEN`, `GH_USERNAME`, `GH_EMAIL`, `NPM_TOKEN`)
- **`.env.example` template** — committed template for environment configuration (`.env` itself remains gitignored)
- **`SETUP_AUTH` env var** — controls whether auth setup runs on container start (default: `true`)
- **`AGENT-REDIRECTION.md`** — guide on how the PreToolUse hook system works, how built-in agents are swapped to custom ones, and what else is possible (prompt injection, model overrides, conditional routing, external service chaining)

### Changed

- **README split by audience** — root `README.md` is now the npm/GitHub landing page (install, prerequisites, what's included, quick start); `.devcontainer/README.md` is now the usage guide (auth, tools, config, agents, keybindings, gotchas). No duplicated content between the two
- **Auto-linter moved to Stop hook** — was PostToolUse (ran pyright per-edit, caused agent re-reads); now batch-lints all edited Python files when Claude stops, matching auto-formatter's pattern. Uses its own temp file (`claude-lint-files-{session_id}`) independent of the formatter pipeline
- **`collect-edited-files.py`** — now writes to both `claude-edited-files-*` (formatter) and `claude-lint-files-*` (linter) temp files, keeping the two Stop hook pipelines independent
- **`.devcontainer/.gitignore`** — added `.secrets` explicit ignore and negation patterns (`!.env.example`, `!.secrets.example`, `!.gitignore`) to override root `.*` rule for files that should be tracked
- **`setup.sh` orchestration** — `setup-auth.sh` runs early (after symlink, before config/plugins) so NPM auth is available for plugin installation
- **`PLUGIN_BLACKLIST`** — cleared (was `"workflow-enhancer,planning-reminder"`)

### Removed

- **`workflow-enhancer` plugin** — deleted entirely (was scaffolding only, never active)
- **`planning-reminder` plugin** — deleted entirely (redundant with Claude Code v2.1+ auto plan mode)

---

## v1.7.0

**Release date:** 2026-02-08

### Added

- **ccburn feature** — new devcontainer feature for visual token burn rate tracking with shell aliases and statusline wrapper
- **Session resume widget** — ccstatusline displays copyable `cc --resume {sessionId}` command on line 5
- **Burn rate widget** — ccstatusline line 6 shows live ccburn compact output with pace indicators (session/weekly/sonnet limits)
- **17 custom agent definitions** — code-directive plugin now includes specialized agents: architect, bash-exec, claude-guide, debug-logs, dependency-analyst, doc-writer, explorer, generalist, git-archaeologist, migrator, perf-profiler, refactorer, researcher, security-auditor, spec-writer, statusline-config, test-writer
- **6 new skills** — claude-agent-sdk, git-forensics, performance-profiling, refactoring-patterns, security-checklist, specification-writing
- **Agent redirect hook** — `redirect-builtin-agents.py` (PreToolUse/Task) transparently swaps built-in agent types (Explore→explorer, Plan→architect, etc.) to enhanced custom agents
- **Readonly bash guard** — `guard-readonly-bash.py` blocks write operations for read-only agents
- **Regression test hooks** — `verify-no-regression.py` (PostToolUse for refactorer) and `verify-tests-pass.py` (Stop for test-writer)
- **REVIEW-RUBRIC.md** — quality standards document for agent/skill development
- **Keybindings configuration** — new `config/keybindings.json` with schema support
- **VS Code terminal passthrough** — `Ctrl+P` and `Ctrl+F` pass through to Claude Code via `terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell`
- **claude-agent-sdk skill** — new code-directive skill for Claude Agent SDK TypeScript integration
- **OVERWRITE_CONFIG documentation** — documented ephemeral settings behavior
- **Project Manager integration** — `setup-projects.sh` auto-detects projects under `/workspaces/`, watches for changes via inotifywait, maintains `projects.json`
- **Claude config symlink** — `setup-symlink-claude.sh` symlinks `~/.claude` → `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for third-party tool compatibility
- **Project Manager VS Code extension** — `alefragnani.project-manager` added to devcontainer

### Changed

- **ccstatusline layout** — expanded from 3→6 lines (13→16 widgets), reorganized into logical groups (core metrics, tokens, git, session, totals, burn rate)
- **ccstatusline version** — bumped from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
- **Plugin declarations centralized** — all 9 marketplace plugins declared in `enabledPlugins` in `config/settings.json`
- **setup-plugins.sh cache sync** — re-added plugin install loop to sync cache from source on every container start; added `.env` fallback so `PLUGIN_BLACKLIST` works on standalone invocation
- **Feature-level config synced** — `features/claude-code/config/settings.json` mirrors main config (model → `claude-opus-4-6`, `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` → `63999`, `cleanupPeriodDays` → `60`, all env vars)
- **8 new env vars** — `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_TOOL_USE_CONCURRENCY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_RETRIES`, `BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH`, `TASK_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH`, `CLAUDE_CODE_PLAN_MODE_INTERVIEW_PHASE`, `CLAUDE_CODE_PLAN_V2_AGENT_COUNT`, `CLAUDE_CODE_PLAN_MODE_REQUIRED`, `CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_GLOBAL_CACHE`
- **setup-config.sh** — added `chown` for correct ownership; added keybindings.json to copy pipeline
- **setup-aliases.sh** — added idempotency guard
- **TMPDIR consistency** — `setup-update-claude.sh` and `ccstatusline/install.sh` use `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}`
- **installsAfter references** — mcp-qdrant and mcp-reasoner updated from `./features/claude-code` to `ghcr.io/anthropics/devcontainer-features/claude-code:1`
- **code-directive hooks.json** — added PreToolUse/Task hook for agent redirection
- **Auto-linter timeout** — pyright reduced from 55s to 10s
- **Auto-formatter tool paths** — resolved via `which` first
- **Protected-files-guard regex** — tightened `id_rsa` pattern
- **Syntax-validator JSONC regex** — handles URLs containing `://`
- **Skill-suggester keywords** — consolidated claude-agent-sdk phrases; added "compose" to docker
- **redirect-builtin-agents.py fix** — `updatedInput` now preserves all original tool input fields (Claude Code replaces rather than merges)
- **System prompt hardened** — added anti-fabrication rule, failure recovery strategy, and silent-violation guard to `execution_discipline` and `rule_precedence`

### Removed

- **setup-irie-claude.sh** — deleted (personal script, no longer invoked)
- **output-style widget** — removed from ccstatusline (low value)

### Documentation

- **CLAUDE.md** — added keybindings.json, updated plugins list, fixed model name, documented VS Code conflicts, documented OVERWRITE_CONFIG, added agents/skills sections, added new scripts
- **README.md** — fixed max output tokens, added keybindings section, added agents/skills, added project manager
- **features/README.md** — full rewrite listing all features
- **CHANGELOG.md** — squashed v1.6.0 + v1.6.1 into this entry

---

## v1.5.8

**Release date:** 2026-02-06

### Changed

- **tmux is now opt-in in VS Code**: Reverted auto-tmux-everywhere approach (forced all terminals into tmux, caused shared-view conflicts and hotkey clashes with Claude Code). Default terminal is plain `bash`. A **"Claude Teams (tmux)"** profile is available from the VS Code terminal dropdown for Agent Teams split-pane sessions. External terminal connectors (WezTerm/iTerm2) are unchanged — they still auto-enter tmux
- **Removed auto-tmux from `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`**: The `exec tmux` block that forced every interactive shell into tmux has been removed from `setup-aliases.sh`

---

## v1.5.3

**Release date:** 2026-02-06

### Added

- **Catppuccin Mocha tmux theme**: Replaced barebones tmux config with Catppuccin v2.1.3. Rounded window tabs, Nerd Font icons, transparent status bar, colored pane borders. Installed at build time via shallow git clone (~200KB, ~2s)

### Fixed

- **ccstatusline powerline glyphs**: Powerline separators/caps were empty strings, rendering as underscores. Now uses proper Nerd Font glyphs (U+E0B0, U+E0B4, U+E0B6)
- **Unicode rendering in external terminals**: tmux rendered ALL Unicode as underscores because `docker exec` doesn't propagate locale vars. External terminal scripts now pass `LANG`/`LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8` and use `tmux -u` to force UTF-8 mode. Locale exports also added to `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` as permanent fallback

- **cc/claude aliases**: Converted from shell functions to simple aliases — functions were not reliably invoked across shell contexts (tmux, docker exec, external terminals), causing Claude to launch without config
- **CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR export**: Now exported in `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` directly, so credentials are found in all shells (not just VS Code terminals where `remoteEnv` applies)

---

## v1.5.0

**Release date:** 2026-02-06

  - **New skill**: `debugging` — Log forensics, Docker log analysis, error pattern recognition
  - **Hooks**: `skill-suggester.py` (UserPromptSubmit, SubagentStart), `syntax-validator.py` + `collect-edited-files.py` (PostToolUse)
  - All 10 existing skills migrated from `codedirective-skills`

#### VS Code Extensions
- `GitHub.vscode-github-actions` — GitHub Actions workflow support

- **Auto-linter**: Switched from PostToolUse to Stop hook
- **Agent-browser**: Optimized to install only Chromium (previously installed all Playwright browsers)

### Removed

- **codedirective-skills plugin**: Replaced by `code-directive` (all skills preserved)
- **format-file.py**: Replaced by `format-on-stop.py`
