Solutions for common issues with the CodeForge devcontainer. If your problem isn't listed here, check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AnExiledDev/CodeForge/issues) or open a new one.

## Installation Issues

**Problem: `npx @coredirective/cf-container` fails.**

- **Node.js not installed** — the installer requires Node.js 18+ and npm. Run `node --version` to check; install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if missing.
- **Network issues** — npm needs to reach the registry. Check your connection or try `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/`.
- **Permission errors** — prefer `npx --yes @coredirective/cf-container` to avoid global install permission issues. If you need global installs, configure your npm prefix or use a Node version manager (e.g., nvm) instead of `sudo`.

**Problem: VS Code doesn't show "Reopen in Container".**

- **Extension not installed** — install `ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers` from the Extensions marketplace, then reload VS Code.
- **`.devcontainer/` not at repo root** — VS Code looks for `.devcontainer/` in the workspace root. If your project is inside a subfolder, open that subfolder directly.
- **VS Code version** — DevContainers requires VS Code 1.85 or later. Check **Help → About** and update if needed.

:::note[Using a different client?]
Not using VS Code? The DevContainer CLI, JetBrains Gateway, DevPod, and Codespaces all read the same `devcontainer.json`. See the [Installation guide](/getting-started/installation/#step-2-open-in-a-devcontainer-client) for client-specific instructions.

## Container Build Failures

**Problem: Container fails to build during feature installation.**

- Check Docker has sufficient memory (6 GB+ recommended). CodeForge sets `--memory=6g` by default.
- If a specific feature fails, disable it temporarily by setting `"version": "none"` in `devcontainer.json`.
- Check internet connectivity — most features download binaries from GitHub releases.
- If hitting GitHub API rate limits during build, set `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` as an environment variable.
- **Docker not running** — start Docker Desktop or the Docker daemon.
- **Cached partial build** — use **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container Without Cache** (VS Code) or `devcontainer up --workspace-folder . --remove-existing-container` (CLI) to start clean.

**Problem: Build is slow or hangs.**

- The mcp-qdrant feature downloads an embedding model (~90 MB). This is normal on first build.
- Use `"version": "none"` to skip optional features you don't need.

:::tip[Disabling Features]
Any local feature can be disabled without removing it from `devcontainer.json` by setting `"version": "none"`. The feature entry stays in the config for easy re-enabling — just remove the version override or set it to `"latest"`.

## Authentication Issues

**Problem: `claude` command fails with authentication error.**

- Run `claude` once interactively to complete authentication.
- If using API key auth, verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set correctly.
- Background update may be in progress — wait 10 seconds and retry.

**Problem: `gh` CLI not authenticated.**

- Run `gh auth status` to check current state.
- Run `gh auth login` for interactive setup.
- Or configure `.devcontainer/.secrets` with `GH_TOKEN` for automatic auth on container start. See [Configuration — Secrets](../customization/configuration/#secrets-file).
- Credentials persist in `/workspaces/.gh/` across rebuilds.

**Problem: Claude auth token not taking effect in Codespaces.**

- When `CLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN` is set via Codespaces secrets, it persists as an environment variable for the entire container lifetime. The `unset` in `setup-auth.sh` only clears it in the child process. This is a Codespaces platform limitation.
- If `.credentials.json` already exists, the token injection is skipped (idempotent). Delete `~/.claude/.credentials.json` to force re-creation from the token.

**Problem: Git push fails with permission error.**

- Run `gh auth status` to verify authentication.
- Check git remote URL: `git remote -v`. HTTPS remotes require `gh` auth; SSH remotes require SSH keys.
- Verify `git config --global user.name` and `user.email` are set.

**Problem: NPM publish/install fails with 401.**

- Set `NPM_TOKEN` in `.devcontainer/.secrets` or as environment variable.
- Verify token: `npm whoami`.

## Feature Installation Failures

**Problem: Feature checksum verification fails.**

- This usually means a corrupted download. Rebuild the container to retry.
- If persistent, the release may have been re-tagged. Try pinning a specific version in `devcontainer.json`.

**Problem: Feature download fails after retries.**

- Check internet connectivity.
- GitHub may be experiencing issues — check [githubstatus.com](https://www.githubstatus.com/).
- Set `GH_TOKEN` environment variable to avoid rate limiting.

**Problem: Permission denied during feature install.**

- Features run as root during build. This shouldn't happen in normal use.
- If modifying features, ensure `install.sh` has execute permissions and starts with `#!/bin/bash`.

## Plugin Issues

**Problem: Plugin not loading or not appearing in Claude Code.**

- Check `enabledPlugins` in `.codeforge/config/settings.json` — the plugin must be listed there.
- Verify the plugin directory exists under `plugins/devs-marketplace/plugins/`.
- Run `check-setup` to verify core configuration is correct.
- Check plugin blacklist: ensure it's not in `PLUGIN_BLACKLIST` in `.env`.

**Problem: Auto-formatter or auto-linter not running.**

- These run on the Stop hook — they only trigger when Claude Code stops (end of conversation turn).
- Verify the underlying tools are installed: `cc-tools` lists all available tools.
- Check the 30-second timeout hasn't been exceeded (large file sets may hit this).

## Agent Teams and tmux Issues

**Problem: Split panes not working.**

- Agent Teams requires tmux. Use the **"Claude Teams (tmux)"** terminal profile in VS Code.
- Verify tmux is installed: `tmux -V`.
- If using an external terminal, connect via `.codeforge/scripts/connect-external-terminal.sh`.

**Problem: tmux Unicode/emoji rendering broken.**

- Ensure locale is set: `echo $LANG` should show `en_US.UTF-8`.
- If not, run `source ~/.bashrc` or open a new terminal.

## "Command Not Found" Errors

**Problem: `cc: command not found` or similar.**

- Run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`) to reload aliases.
- Or open a new terminal.
- Verify setup ran: check for `# Claude Code environment and aliases` in your rc file.

**Problem: Tool not found (e.g., `ruff`, `dprint`).**

- Run `cc-tools` to see which tools are installed.
- Check if the feature was disabled with `"version": "none"` in `devcontainer.json`.
- Some tools (like `ruff`) install to `~/.local/bin` — ensure it's in your `PATH`.

## Performance Issues

**Problem: Container is slow or running out of memory.**

- CodeForge defaults to 6 GB RAM / 12 GB swap. Increase in `devcontainer.json` `runArgs`.
- Disable features you don't need with `"version": "none"`.
- The background Claude Code update runs once on startup — it's not persistent.

**Problem: Slow startup.**

- First start is slower due to `postStartCommand` running all setup scripts.
- Subsequent starts skip unchanged config files (SHA-256 comparison).
- Disable steps you don't need via `.env` (e.g., `SETUP_PROJECTS=false`). See [Environment Variables — Setup Variables](./environment/#setup-variables-env).

## Docker Permission Errors (Linux)

**Problem: `docker: permission denied` or `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`.**

- Add your user to the `docker` group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`, then log out and back in.
- Verify with `docker ps` — it should run without `sudo`.
- If using Docker rootless mode, ensure the socket path is set correctly in VS Code settings.

## WSL 2 Integration Issues (Windows)

**Problem: Container fails to start, or Docker commands hang inside WSL.**

- Open Docker Desktop → **Settings → Resources → WSL Integration** and enable integration for your WSL distro.
- Ensure WSL 2 (not WSL 1) is active: run `wsl -l -v` in PowerShell and check the VERSION column.
- Restart Docker Desktop after changing WSL settings.

## Port Conflicts

**Problem: The codeforge-dashboard or other tools fail to bind their port.**

- CodeForge's session dashboard uses **port 7847** by default. If another service uses that port, change it in `devcontainer.json` under `forwardPorts`.
- To find what's using a port: `lsof -i :7847` (macOS/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr 7847` (Windows).

## Slow Rebuilds

**Problem: Rebuilding the container takes as long as the first build.**

- **Use "Rebuild Container"** (not "Rebuild Without Cache") for routine rebuilds — Docker reuses cached layers for unchanged steps.
- **Prune unused images** to free disk space: `docker system prune -a` removes all unused images (confirm you don't need them first).
- **Check disk space** — Docker needs headroom for layer storage. If your disk is nearly full, builds may fail or slow down significantly.

## How to Reset

1. **Reset runtime config** — delete `~/.claude/` and restart the container. `setup-config.sh` will redeploy all files from `.codeforge/config/`. This resets the deployed copies but preserves your `.codeforge/` source files (user modifications remain intact).

2. **Restore default config sources** — run `git checkout .codeforge/config/` to discard any local edits to the source files, then restart the container to redeploy.

3. **Reset aliases** — delete the `# Claude Code environment and aliases` block from `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc`, then run `bash .devcontainer/scripts/setup-aliases.sh` from your project root (or `/workspaces/.devcontainer/scripts/setup-aliases.sh` for workspace-scoped installs).

4. **Full reset** — rebuild the container from scratch (VS Code: **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container**). This recreates everything but still preserves `.codeforge/` user modifications since they live in the repository.

5. **Reset a single feature** — set it to `"version": "none"`, rebuild, then set it back to the desired version and rebuild again.
