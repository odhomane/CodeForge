CodeForge runs inside a Docker container. When a service inside the container listens on a port (e.g., a dev server on port 3000 or the Claude Dashboard on port 7847), you need a forwarding mechanism to access it from your host machine. Which mechanism to use depends on your DevContainer client.

## Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Client | Discovery | Setup Required |
|-----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| VS Code auto-detect | VS Code only | Dynamic — all ports | None |
| devcontainer-bridge (`dbr`) | Any terminal client | Dynamic — polls `/proc/net/tcp` | Host daemon required |
| SSH tunneling | Any SSH client | Manual | Per-port command |

## VS Code Auto-Detect

VS Code automatically detects ports opened inside the container and forwards them to your host. CodeForge configures this in `devcontainer.json`:

- **All ports** are auto-forwarded with a notification prompt
- **Port 7847** (Claude Dashboard) gets a friendly label in the Ports panel

No setup required — ports appear in the VS Code **Ports** panel as services start. Click the local address to open in your browser.

:::caution[Requires VS Code to be running]
Port forwarding only works while VS Code is open and connected to the devcontainer. If you close VS Code or disconnect, all forwarded ports become inaccessible. For persistent port forwarding that doesn't depend on your editor, use [devcontainer-bridge](#devcontainer-bridge-dbr).
:::

:::note
This only works inside VS Code and GitHub Codespaces. The `devcontainer` CLI, JetBrains Gateway, and DevPod ignore `portsAttributes` in `devcontainer.json`.

## devcontainer-bridge (`dbr`)

[devcontainer-bridge](https://github.com/bradleybeddoes/devcontainer-bridge) provides dynamic port forwarding for any terminal-based workflow. It works with the DevContainer CLI, SSH connections, or any other way you access the container.

### How It Works

1. A lightweight daemon inside the container polls `/proc/net/tcp` to discover listening ports
2. A host-side daemon maintains SSH tunnels for each discovered port
3. Ports are forwarded automatically as services start and stop — no manual configuration

The container daemon **auto-starts** when the container boots and is inert (zero overhead) until the host daemon connects.

### Setup

**Inside the container** — already done. CodeForge installs `dbr` as a DevContainer feature.

**On your host machine**, install and start the host daemon:

```bash
# Install dbr on your host (see https://github.com/bradleybeddoes/devcontainer-bridge/releases)
# Then start the host daemon:
dbr host-daemon
```

The host daemon discovers running containers and establishes port forwarding automatically. Leave it running in the background while you work.

### Verify

Once the host daemon is running, any port opened inside the container becomes accessible on `localhost` on your host. Test with:

```bash
# Inside the container
python -m http.server 8080

# On your host
curl http://localhost:8080
```

### Platform Support

| Platform | Host Daemon | Auto-Forward | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| macOS    | Supported   | Expected to work | Not fully confirmed |
| Linux    | Supported   | Expected to work | Not fully confirmed |
| Windows  | Not yet supported | — | Future fix planned |

:::note
devcontainer-bridge auto-forwarding on macOS and Linux has not been fully validated across all configurations. If you encounter issues, fall back to SSH tunneling and [report the issue](https://github.com/bradleybeddoes/devcontainer-bridge/issues). Windows host daemon support is planned for a future release.
:::

## SSH Tunneling

For one-off port forwarding or environments where `dbr` isn't available, use SSH tunneling directly:

```bash
# Forward a single port
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 <container-user>@<container-host>

# Forward multiple ports
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 -L 7847:localhost:7847 <container-user>@<container-host>
```

This requires SSH access to the container, which is available when connecting via the `devcontainer` CLI or any Docker SSH setup.

## Which Should I Use?

| If you use... | Recommended mechanism |
|---------------|----------------------|
| VS Code | Auto-detect (built-in, zero config) |
| DevContainer CLI | `dbr` (dynamic, automatic) — see the [CLI guide](/getting-started/devcontainer-cli/) |
| JetBrains Gateway | Gateway's built-in forwarding, or `dbr` as fallback |
| Codespaces | Auto-detect (built-in to Codespaces) |
| DevPod | DevPod's built-in SSH tunneling, or `dbr` |
| Direct SSH | SSH tunneling for specific ports, or `dbr` for all ports |

## Configuration

Port forwarding behavior is configured in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```jsonc
"forwardPorts": [7847],
"portsAttributes": {
    "7847": {
        "label": "CodeForge Dashboard",
        "onAutoForward": "notify"
    },
    "*": {
        "onAutoForward": "notify"
    }
}
```

- `forwardPorts` — static port list (dashboard port 7847 is pre-configured; VS Code also auto-detects dynamically)
- `portsAttributes` — labels and behavior for auto-detected ports (VS Code / Codespaces only)

These settings are ignored by non-VS Code clients. Use `dbr` or SSH tunneling instead.
