All CLI commands and slash commands available in the CodeForge DevContainer. Commands are shell aliases and functions defined in `setup-aliases.sh` and deployed to `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` on container start.

## Session Commands

Commands for launching and managing Claude Code sessions.

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `cc` | Launch Claude Code with the main system prompt, plugins, and plan mode | `cc` |
| `claude` | Identical to `cc` | `claude` |
| `ccw` | Launch Claude Code with the writing system prompt (for docs and prose) | `ccw` |
| `ccraw` | Launch vanilla Claude Code with no custom config, prompts, or plugins | `ccraw` |
| `cc-orc` | Launch Claude Code in orchestrator mode (delegation-first workflow) | `cc-orc` |

All session commands auto-detect the Claude binary location: `~/.local/bin/claude` (native install) is preferred, then `/usr/local/bin/claude`, then PATH lookup. If ChromaTerm (`ct`) is installed, output is wrapped through it for color highlighting.

:::caution[Permissions Flag]
The `cc`, `claude`, and `ccw` aliases include the `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions` flag, which enables non-interactive permission handling. The aliases also set `CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD=1` so Claude reads CLAUDE.md files from parent directories. Use `ccraw` if you need a session without these flags or env vars.
:::

:::tip[Resuming Sessions]
Use `cc --resume <session-id>` to resume a previous session. The session ID is displayed in the status line during active sessions.

## Analysis and Monitoring Commands

Commands for session analysis, usage tracking, and system monitoring.

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `ccms` | Search Claude Code session history. Supports boolean queries, role filtering, time scoping, and project isolation. _(currently disabled — replaced by `codeforge session search`)_ | `ccms --project "$(pwd)" "auth approach"` |
| `ccusage` | View Claude API usage statistics | `ccusage` |
| `ccburn` | Analyze token burn rate and consumption patterns with pace indicators _(disabled by default — uncomment in devcontainer.json to enable)_ | `ccburn` |
| `ccstatusline` | Terminal status line displaying session metrics, git state, token usage, and burn rate | (runs automatically) |
| `codeforge-dashboard` | Web-based session monitoring dashboard on port 7847 with cost estimates and activity heatmaps | `codeforge-dashboard` |
| `claude-monitor` | Real-time Claude session activity monitor | `claude-monitor` |
| `agent-browser` | Headless Chromium browser for agent automation with accessibility tree snapshots | `agent-browser` |
| `check-setup` | Verify CodeForge installation health -- checks tools, config, and aliases | `check-setup` |
| `cc-tools` | List all installed CodeForge CLI tools with version info | `cc-tools` |
| `dbr` | Dynamic port forwarding via devcontainer-bridge (container↔host) | `dbr` |

## Code Quality Commands

Pre-installed tools for linting, formatting, and code analysis.

| Command | Languages | Purpose | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `ruff` | Python | Fast linting and formatting (replaces Black + Flake8) | `ruff check . --fix` |
| `biome` | JS/TS/JSON/CSS | Unified linting and formatting | `biome check .` |
| `shellcheck` | Shell | Script linting with structured diagnostics | `shellcheck script.sh` |
| `shfmt` | Shell | Script formatting | `shfmt -w script.sh` |
| `dprint` | MD/TOML/YAML | Pluggable multi-language formatter | `dprint fmt` |
| `hadolint` | Dockerfile | Dockerfile best practice linting | `hadolint Dockerfile` |

:::note[Optional Tools]
Some code quality tools ship with `"version": "none"` in `devcontainer.json` (disabled by default). To enable them, set a specific version or `"latest"` in the feature configuration and rebuild the container.
:::

## Code Intelligence Commands

Commands for structural code search and syntax analysis. These tools understand code structure (AST) rather than treating source files as plain text.

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `ag` / `sg` | ast-grep -- structural code search using AST patterns. Find code by structure, not text. | `sg -p 'console.log($$$)' -l js` |
| `tree-sitter` | Tree-sitter CLI -- parsing, syntax tree operations, and grammar development | `tree-sitter parse file.py` |

### ast-grep Examples

```bash
# Find all console.log statements in JavaScript
sg -p 'console.log($$$)' -l js

# Find functions with more than 3 parameters in Python
sg -p 'def $FUNC($A, $B, $C, $D, $$$)' -l python

# Find unused imports in TypeScript
sg -p 'import { $NAME } from $_' -l ts
```

### tree-sitter Examples

```bash
# Parse a file and show the syntax tree
tree-sitter parse file.py

# Highlight a file with syntax colors
tree-sitter highlight file.py
```

## Spec Workflow Slash Commands

Slash commands for specification-driven development. These are used within Claude Code sessions (type them in the chat, not the shell).

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/spec <feature>` | Create, refine, and approve a spec package | `/spec user-signup` |
| `/spec constitution` | Create or update the project Constitution | `/spec constitution` |
| `/build <feature>` | Implement from spec — plan, build, review, and close | `/build user-signup` |
| `/specs` | Dashboard: spec health across the project | `/specs` |

## Ticket Workflow Slash Commands

Slash commands for issue and ticket management within Claude Code sessions.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/ticket:new` | Create a new GitHub issue in EARS format |
| `/ticket:work` | Start working on a ticket with a technical implementation plan |
| `/ticket:create-pr` | Generate a PR from ticket context with security review |
| `/ticket:review-commit` | Review commits against ticket requirements |

## Git Workflow Slash Commands

Standalone slash commands for git operations within Claude Code sessions. These work independently of the ticket workflow but optionally link to tickets when context exists.

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/ship` | Review changes, commit, push, and optionally create a PR | `/ship` |
| `/pr:review` | Review an existing PR and post findings (never merges) | `/pr:review 42` |

### `/ship` Workflow

1. Gathers git context (status, diff, branch, project rules)
2. Conducts full review (security, rules, quality, architecture, tests)
3. Presents findings by severity — user decides what to fix, defer to issues, or ignore
4. Drafts commit message — user must approve before committing
5. Commits and pushes
6. Asks whether to create a PR — only creates if user confirms

### `/pr:review` Workflow

1. Identifies target PR (by number, URL, or auto-detects from current branch)
2. Fetches PR details, diff, and reads changed files in full
3. Conducts aggressive analysis (attack surface, threat modeling, dependencies, rules, architecture, quality, tests, breaking changes)
4. Presents findings — user selects what to include in review, create as issues, or ignore
5. Posts review comment to PR (never approves or merges)

## CodeForge CLI Commands (Experimental)

:::caution[Experimental]
The `codeforge` CLI is under active development. Commands and interfaces may change between releases.
:::
