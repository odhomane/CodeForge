Skills are domain-specific knowledge packs that give Claude deep expertise in specific technologies, patterns, and workflows. Instead of relying on general training data, a loaded skill injects structured, curated knowledge — best practices, code patterns, API references, mental models, and common pitfalls — directly into Claude's context for your current task.

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file containing structured knowledge organized around a central mental model. When loaded, this knowledge becomes part of Claude's working context, giving it the equivalent of having a senior specialist's reference guide open while working on your code.

### Auto-Suggestion

The skill engine monitors your conversation and automatically suggests relevant skills based on context. If you start discussing FastAPI routes, the `fastapi` skill is suggested. If you mention refactoring a class, `refactoring-patterns` appears. You can accept the suggestion to load the skill, or ignore it and continue working.

### Manual Invocation

You can also load skills explicitly when you know you need specific expertise. Skills declared in an agent's configuration are loaded automatically when that agent is spawned.

:::tip[When skills shine]
Skills are most valuable when you are working in a specific domain and need Claude to follow established patterns rather than improvise. Loading the `testing` skill before writing tests ensures Claude follows your project's pytest conventions. Loading `security-checklist` before a review ensures no OWASP category is missed.

:::note[Skills vs Agents]
Skills and agents serve different purposes. An **agent** is a specialized Claude instance with specific tools and constraints — it *does work*. A **skill** is a knowledge pack that *informs work* — it provides the patterns, best practices, and domain knowledge that make an agent (or the main Claude session) more effective. Many agents have associated skills that load automatically when the agent is spawned.
